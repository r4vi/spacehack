Imagine how that sense of frustration might magnify when, instead of trying to wrap the head of a wrench around a leaky nut under the kitchen counter, the scenario involves conducting repairs on the International Space Station while floating nearly 200 miles above Earth. To ease this frustration, NASA funded work on autonomous robotic devices that would be able to retrieve tools and even crew outside of the station.\n            \n            Partnership\n            \n            Barrett Technology Inc., of Cambridge, Massachusetts, completed three Phase II Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contracts with Johnson Space Center. In 1989, the company worked with NASA on a Phase II to create a robotic arm, and in 1991, was again awarded a Phase II to create a hand. Nearly a decade later, the company was awarded a third Phase II for further miniaturization of the components that comprise the robotic devices.          \n          Product Outcome\n            \n  Barrett has developed and commercialized three core technologies that trace their roots directly back to the SBIR work with NASA. The first is a robotic arm, the whole-arm manipulation (WAM) system; the second is a hand that functions atop the arm, the BH8-Series; and the third is a motor driver that the company refers to as “the puck,” as it is similar in shape to a hockey puck, but one-tenth the size.\n            \n          \n          \n  \n  \n    \n  \n  \n            The BarrettHand is a multifingered programmable grasper with the dexterity to secure target objects of different sizes, shapes, and orientations.\n  \n\n          The SBIR work with NASA led to the development of the first commercially available cable-driven robot, a distinction that earned Barrett a place in the “Guinness World Records” book as the world’s most advanced robotic arm. Designed for applications that require superior adaptability, programmability, and dexterity, the WAM can reach around large objects and grasp them with its arm links like huge fingers, while conventional robotic arms are restricted to hand end-effectors, and thus restricted to grasping smaller objects. The WAM has other advantages over traditional robotic arms, in that it uses gear-free cables to manipulate its joints, allowing it to feel and control subtle forces.\n            \n            The arm consists of a shoulder that operates on a gearless differential mechanism, an upper arm, and a gear-free elbow, forearm, and wrist. This arrangement of joints coincides with the human shoulder and elbow, but with much greater range of motion. Like a person’s arm, but unlike any industrial robotic arm, the WAM Arm is backdriveable, meaning that any contact force along the arm or its hand is immediately felt at the motors, supporting graceful control of interactions with walls, objects, and even people. With a human-scale 3-foot reach, it is so quick that it can grab a major-league fastball, yet so sensitive that it responds to the gentlest touch. The WAM Arm is available in two main configurations, four-degrees-of-freedom and seven-degrees-of-freedom, both with human-like kinematics. Internally protected channels allow the user to pass electric lines and fiber optics required for custom end-effectors and sensors.\n            \n            These characteristics make it ideal for myriad applications, including in space, where use of robots is often safer than people, in manufacturing, and in medicine.\n            \n            Recently, an adaptation of the WAM has been cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in a minimally invasive knee surgery procedure, where its precision control makes it ideal for inserting a very small implant. Barrett Technology licensed the arm to MAKO Surgical Corporation, of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, for use in the company’s “keyhole” orthopedic surgery procedures.\n            \n            The company uses small titanium knee implants instead of the more common and more traumatic total-knee replacement, thus limiting surgery to only the diseased part of the bone. These surgeries, however, require an array of complex implant shapes to cover the variety of disease patterns and bone geometries. To insert these devices, surgeons generally cut small pockets into the diseased bone with a high-speed, hand-held cutting device. While lacking in robotic precision, this technique provides the surgeon with the tactile sensation of the cutting, which in turn provides a wealth of intuitive information about the diseased bone that is not available from preoperative X-rays.  \n            \n                \n          \n  \n  \n    \n  \n  \n            The BarrettHand offers unmatched versatility, programmability, and ease of integration with commercial robotic arms, including the Barrett WAM Arm.\n  \n\n          The WAM-based technologies combine the best of a surgeon’s intuition and a robot’s precision through active haptics (touch sensing). The WAM Arm improves the precision of the implant pockets while still allowing the surgeon to feel bone condition. Matching pocket and implant geometries minimizes trauma, ensures secure implant retention, and optimizes resulting joint functionality.\n            \n            Like the WAM Arm, the BH8-262 BarrettHand offers many benefits in dexterity. A multifingered programmable grasper, the BarrettHand can pick up objects of different sizes, shapes, and orientations. According to the company, integrating this device immediately multiplies the value of any arm requiring flexible automation. Even with its low weight (1.18kg) and compact form, it is totally self-contained. Plus, communicating by industry-standard serial communications, integration with any robotic arm is fast and simple.\n            \n            The BarrettHand BH8-Series neatly houses a CPU, software, communications electronics, servo-controllers, and four brushless motors. Of its three multijointed fingers, two have an extra degree of freedom with 180 degrees of synchronous lateral mobility supporting a large variety of grasp types.\n            \n            Barrett’s Ultra-Miniature Puck Brushless Servo Electronics Module, or “Puck,” is the world’s smallest and most power-efficient, high-performance servomotor controller. It is based on the work done with NASA, as well as grants from the U.S. Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation (NSF). Barrett has been shipping the Pucks in all of its robotic WAM Arms for the past 3 years, because the device offers several distinct advantages: the absence of a controller cabinet improves reliability and portability; the incredibly low power consumption (an order of magnitude less than any other arm in its class) increases safety and portability, while also making the device “greener;” and the ultra-high brushless-servo performance enables applications such as force-field-enabled medical surgery.\n            \n            While the Puck is not currently available outside the WAM Arm today, Barrett has applied for NSF funding to develop features to make this module universally adaptable within 3 years to a wide range of brushless-servomotor applications.\n            \n            WAM™, BarrettHand™, and Puck™ are trademarks of Barrett Technology Inc. \n            \n                          \n              \n                \n                \n                \n                \n              \n                                \n          "},{"href":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/hm_2.html","text":"In-Line Filtration Improves Hygiene and Reduces Expense","image":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/images/HOF-Medal_opt.jpeg","story":"\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n  \n    Health and Medicine\n    \n\n\n  Originating Technology/NASA Contribution\n  Water, essential to sustaining life on Earth, is that much more highly prized in the unforgiving realm of space travel and habitation. Given a launch cost of $10,000 per pound for space shuttle cargo, however, each gallon of water at 8.33 pounds quickly makes Chanel No. 5 a bargain at $25,000 per gallon. Likewise, ample water reserves for drinking, food preparation, and bathing would take up an inordinate amount of storage space and infrastructure, which is always at a premium on a vessel or station. \n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n              The DentaPure waterline purification cartridge sees use in 40 percent of dental schools in the United States and is lauded for offering remarkable filtration and significant cost savings.\n    \n  \n  Water rationing and recycling are thus an essential part of daily life and operations on the space shuttles and International Space Station (ISS). In orbit, where Earth’s natural life support system is missing, the ISS itself has to provide abundant power, clean water, and breathable air at the right temperature and humidity for the duration of human habitation and with virtually no waste. The Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS), under continuing developmet at the Marshall Space Flight Center, helps astronauts use and reuse their precious supplies of water. Future work will explore air management, thermal control, and fire suppression—in short, all of the things that will make human habitation in space comfortable and safe.\n  The ECLSS Water Recycling System (WRS), developed at Marshall, reclaims wastewaters from humans and lab animals in the form of breath condensate, urine, hygiene and washing, and other wastewater streams. On Earth, biological wastewater is physically filtered by granular soil and purified as microbes in the soil break down urea, converting it to a form that plants can absorb and use to build new tissue. Wastewater also evaporates and returns as fresh rain water—a natural form of distillation. WRS water purification machines on the ISS mimic these processes, though without microbes or the scale of these processes.\n  Partnership \n  Umpqua Research Company, of Myrtle Creek, Oregon, supplier of the bacterial filters used in the life support backpacks worn by space-walking astronauts, received a number of Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contracts from the Johnson Space Center to develop air and water purification technologies for human missions in space. A natural choice for water purification research, Umpqua has also provided the only space-certified and approved-for-flight water purification system, which has flown on all shuttle missions since 1990.\n  To prevent back-contamination of a drinking water supply by microorganisms, Umpqua developed the microbial check valve, consisting of a flow-through cartridge containing iodinated ion exchange resin. In addition to the microbial contact kill, the resin was found to impart a biocidal residual elemental iodine concentration to the water. Umpqua’s valve and resin system was adopted by NASA as the preferred means of disinfecting drinking water aboard U.S. spacecraft, and canisters are now used on space shuttle missions, the ISS, and for ground-based testing of closed life support technology. Iodine was selected by NASA as the disinfectant of choice because of its lower vapor pressure and reduced propensity for formation of disinfection byproducts compared to chlorine or bromine.\n  Product Outcome\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n              Long service intervals of up to a year and ease of installation make the DentaPure cartridge particularly user-friendly.\n    \n  \n  MRLB International Inc., of Fergus Falls, Minnesota, used Umpqua’s water purification technology in the design of the DentaPure waterline purification cartridge (Spinoff 1998). The cartridge incorporated a resin technology developed by private sector commercialization of Umpqua’s system developed under NASA contract. NASA “was an excellent resource,” stated Barry Hammarback, president and CEO of MRLB, “and greatly assisted our transition of the iodinated resin technology to the dental industry.” DentaPure was designed to clean and decontaminate water as a link between filter and high-speed dental tools and other instruments, and offers easy installation on all modern dental unit waterlines with weekly replacement cycles. The product, like its NASA forebear, furnished disinfected water and maintained water purity even with “suckback,” an effect caused by imperfect anti-retraction valves in dental instruments, which draws blood, saliva, and other materials from a patient’s mouth into the waterline. \n  Since its appearance in Spinoff 1998, MRLB has continued to use the research conducted by Umpqua to further develop and refine its DentaPure in-line filters. Various models now address a variety of needs, and are used in dental offices and schools across the country. MRLB has paid particular attention to extending the life in lower water usage units—products that before touted a service/replacement interval of 7 days now require changing once every 40 to 365 days. In addition, DentaPure offers remarkable filtration: registered to provide 200 CFU/ml purity (Colony Forming Unit/milliliter, a standard measure of microbial concentration)—the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) standard is 500 CFU, and untreated lines can harbor in excess of 1,000,000 CFU/ml. \n  Continued evolution and improvement has led to many unique certifications and commendations for DentaPure. Currently, the only waterline system recognized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a medical device which meets all known standards, and by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as an antimicrobial device, DentaPure has also been tested and utilized by the U.S. Air Force and dental schools in the United States and Europe, and was recognized by Clinical Research Associates as “Outstanding Product 2005.” \n  Better filtration, greater capacity, and longer service intervals have also led to great savings—the University of Maryland Dental School estimates it saves $274,000 per year courtesy of DentaPure. The DentaPure system has proven so effective that 40 percent of dental schools nationwide employ it. Dr. Louis DePaola of the University of Maryland affirms, “The biggest benefit is that we have a system that is efficacious and user-friendly, in that it allows us to consistently deliver water that meets or exceeds CDC standards with a minimum of staff interaction—attach the unit and except for periodic monitoring you don’t have to do anything for a year. It’s very cost-effective—for a large institution like ours with an excess of 300 units, a daily or weekly treatment isnot practical.”\n  DentaPure is currently the number one product for constant chemical treatment applications in dentistry, and was the first treatment to meet CFU standards without interim cleaning protocols—the primary means by which it saves money. Turning to the future, Hammarback sees DentaPure “looking at remote site water purification for continuous use, providing yet longer lasting devices, and increasing product recycling.” Ten years after Spinoff first profiled the many benefits of this technology it is utilized every day in myriad dental offices, schools, and labs, saving hundreds of thousands of dollars a year for users such as the University of Maryland. The investment in water filtration for space missions continues to pay huge dividends to users and society, year after year, in technologies so woven into our lives that we use them without even thinking about them. \n  DentaPure® is a registered trademark of MRLB International Inc.\n  \n\n\n  \n                    \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                    \n                    \n\n"},{"href":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/hm_3.html","text":"LED Device Illuminates New Path to Healing","image":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/images/HOF-Medal_opt.jpeg","story":"\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n  \n      Health and Medicine\n      \n\n\n  Originating Technology/NASA Contribution\n  Among NASA’s research goals is increased understanding of factors affecting plant growth, including the effects of microgravity. Impeding such studies, traditional light sources used to grow plants on Earth are difficult to adapt to space flight, as they require considerable amounts of power and produce relatively large amounts of heat. As such, an optimized experimental system requires much less energy and reduces temperature variance without negatively affecting plant growth results.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n                Studies have shown red LEDs are a viable light source for growing plants in space flight due to their small mass and volume, wavelength specificity, longevity, and safe operation.\n    \n  \n  Ronald W. Ignatius, founder and chairman of the board at Quantum Devices Inc. (QDI), of Barneveld, Wisconsin, proposed using light-emitting diodes (LEDs) as the photon source for plant growth experiments in space. This proposition was made at a meeting held by the Wisconsin Center for Space Automation and Robotics, a NASA-sponsored research center that facilitates the commercialization of robotics, automation, and other advanced technologies. The Wisconsin group teamed with QDI to determine whether an LED system could provide the necessary wavelengths and intensities for photosynthesis, and the resultant system proved successful. The center then produced the Astroculture3, a plant growth chamber that successfully incorporated this LED light source, which has now flown on several space shuttle missions.\n  NASA subsequently identified another need that could be addressed with the use of LEDs: astronaut health. A central concern in astronaut health is maintaining healthy growth of cells, including preventing bone and muscle loss and boosting the body’s ability to heal wounds—all adversely affected by prolonged weightlessness. Thus, having determined that LEDs can be used to grow plants in space, NASA decided to investigate whether LEDs might be used for photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT). \n  PBMT is an emerging medical and veterinary technique in which exposure to high-intensity, wavelength-specific light can stimulate or inhibit cellular function. PBMT modulates a body’s organelles—structures within a cell (e.g., mitochondria, vacuoles, and chloroplasts) that store food, discharge waste, produce energy, or perform other functions analogous to the role of organs in the body as a whole—with wavelength-specific photon energy to increase respiratory metabolism, reduce the natural inflammatory response, accelerate recovery of injury or stress at the cellular level, and increase circulation.\n  Partnership\n  A NASA Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contract was granted to QDI to develop an LED light source for use in a surgical environment as the photon source for its proprietary Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) treatment. An emerging cancer treatment, PDT requires high-intensity, monochromatic light to turn on the cancer-killing properties of a drug, allowing physicians to activate a drug in the tumor only. \n  QDI and Dr. Harry T. Whelan of the Medical College of Wisconsin (known for groundbreaking research in PBMT) based their work on QDI’s High Emissivity Aluminiferous Light-emitting Substrate (HEALS) technology, which was developed for use in the plant growth experiments in 1993. Several SBIR contracts from NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center between 1995 and 1998 helped QDI continue the evolution of HEALS in collaboration with Whelan, and the technology was successfully applied in cases of pediatric brain tumors and the prevention of oral mucositis in pediatric bone marrow transplant patients.\n  QDI then used a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) SBIR contract to develop the WARP 10 (Warfighter Accelerated Recovery by Photobiomodulation) unit as a full realization of its PBMT research. WARP 10, a hand-held, portable, HEALS technology originally intended for military first aid applications, received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance in 2003, and a consumer version was introduced for temporary relief of minor muscle and joint pain. WARP 10 has been found to relieve arthritis, muscle spasms, and stiffness; promote relaxation of tissue; and temporarily increase local blood circulation.\n  Product Outcome\n  Since HEALS and WARP 10 were originally profiled in Spinoff 2005, a flurry of activity has seen this unique technology showered in awards and the next-generation LED device gain FDA clearance and enter the market. \n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n                The WARP 75 (left) has 7.5 times more coverage area than the previously developed WARP 10 (right). The FDA has cleared the WARP 75 for the treatment of chronic pain, including the temporary relief of minor muscle and joint pain, arthritis, muscle spasms, and stiffness, by promoting relaxation of muscle tissue and temporarily increasing local blood circulation.\n    \n  \n  The HEALS and WARP 10 technologies have accrued an impressive résumé; the list of accolades received includes induction into the Space Technology Hall of Fame in 2000; being named a Marshall Space Flight Center “Hallmark of Success” as an outstanding commercialization of an SBIR-developed technology in 2004; and winning first place in the Wisconsin “Governor’s New Product Awards” in 2005 for the development of WARP 10. The greatest and most recent accolade came in 2006, when QDI was nominated for and received a “Tibbetts Award.” \n  Named for Roland Tibbetts, the acknowledged “father of the SBIR program,” it is an annual government-wide award for small firms, projects, organizations, and individuals judged to exemplify the very best in SBIR achievement. These prestigious national awards emphasize recognizing those accomplishments where, in the judgment of those closely involved and often most immediately affected, the stimulus of SBIR funding has made an important and definable difference. Economic impact of technological innovation, business achievement, effective collaborations, demonstrated state and regional impact, and proven support are the main considerations.\n  On the heels of this honor, 2007 saw FDA clearance for the new WARP 75 device, the latest iteration of the technology that began with the HEALS technology. The WARP 75 improves on the WARP 10 design, boasting 7.5 times the actual coverage area of the WARP 10 (75cm2 versus 10cm2), an automatic timed cycle of 88 seconds with an audible alarm, AC power, the ability to be mounted on an articulated arm, and fan cooling. System controls are located on the top panel for easy light dose delivery, and the device is placed directly against the skin where treatment is desired. The unit can be operated with one hand and remains cool to the touch during operation.\n  The WARP 75 continues the legacy of its predecessors in clinical trials with the Medical College of Wisconsin and the University of Alabama at Birmingham for the amelioration of oral mucositis pain in bone marrow transplant patients. QDI is exploring other medical applications of the HEALS-based technology, including combating the symptoms of bone atrophy, multiple sclerosis, diabetic complications, Parkinson’s disease, and a variety of ocular applications. Most recently, Marshall awarded QDI another grant to study synergistic wound healing and conduct a PDT study with silver nanoclusters. Through all of their work, QDI remains dedicated to the principle that light provides the power for all life on Earth, and the belief that the quality, delivery, and control of light is essential to the wellness of the human race and our advancement into the future.\n  HEALS®, WARP 10®, and WARP 75® are registered trademarks, and Photodynamic Therapy™ is a trademark of Quantum Devices Inc.\n    \n    \n    \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n  \n\n"},{"href":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/hm_4.html","text":"Polymer Coats Leads on Implantable Medical Device","image":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/images/R-D_thumb_opt.jpeg","story":"\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n    \n    Health and Medicine\n  \n\n\n  Originating Technology/NASA Contribution\n  Langley Research Center’s Soluble Imide (LaRC-SI) was discovered by accident. While researching resins and adhesives for advanced composites for high-speed aircraft, Robert Bryant, a Langley engineer, noticed that one of the polymers he was working with did not behave as predicted. After putting the compound through a two-stage controlled chemical reaction, expecting it to precipitate as a powder after the second stage, he was surprised to see that the compound remained soluble. This novel characteristic ended up making this polymer a very significant finding, eventually leading Bryant and his team to win several NASA technology awards, and an “R&D 100” award. \n  The unique feature of this compound is the way that it lends itself to easy processing. Most polyimides (members of a group of remarkably strong and incredibly heat- and chemical-resistant polymers) require complex curing cycles before they are usable. LaRC-SI remains soluble in its final form, so no further chemical processing is required to produce final materials, like thin films and varnishes. Since producing LaRC-SI does not require complex manufacturing techniques, it has been processed into useful forms for a variety of applications, including mechanical parts, magnetic components, ceramics, adhesives, composites, flexible circuits, multilayer printed circuits, and coatings on fiber optics, wires, and metals.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n                Medtronic’s cardiac resynchronization therapy devices use the NASA-developed polymer as insulation on thin metal lead wires.\n    \n  \n  Bryant’s team was, at the time, heavily involved with the aircraft polymer project and could not afford to further develop the polymer resin. Believing it was worth further exploration, though, he developed a plan for funding development and submitted it to Langley’s chief scientist, who endorsed the experimentation. Bryant then left the high-speed civil transport project to develop LaRC-SI. The result is an extremely tough, lightweight thermoplastic that is not only solvent-resistant, but also has the ability to withstand temperature ranges from cryogenic levels to above 200 °C. The thermoplastic’s unique characteristics lend it to many commercial applications; uses that Bryant believed would ultimately benefit industry and the Nation. “LaRC-SI,” he explains, “is a product created in a government laboratory, funded with money from the tax-paying public. What we discovered helps further the economic competitiveness of the United States, and it was our goal to initiate the technology transfer process to ensure that our work benefited the widest range of people.” \n  Several NASA centers, including Langley, have explored methods for using LaRC-SI in a number of applications from radiation shielding and as an adhesive to uses involving replacement of conventional rigid circuit boards. In the commercial realm, LaRC-SI can now be found in several commercial products, including the thin-layer composite unimorph ferroelectric driver and sensor (THUNDER) piezoelectric actuator, another “R&D 100” award winner (Spinoff 2005). \n  Partnership\n  Working with the Innovative Partnerships Program office at Langley, Medtronic Inc., of Minneapolis, Minnesota, licensed the material. This material has been evaluated for space applications, high-performance composites, and harsh environments; however, this partnership represents the first time that the material has been used in a medical device. \n  According to Bryant, “This partnership validates the belief we had that LaRC-SI needed to be introduced in (or by) the private sector: Lives can be saved and enhanced because we were able to develop our laboratory findings and provide public access to the material.”\n  Product Outcome\n  \n    \n    \n      \n              \n    \n    \n      LaRC-SI is an amorphous thermoplastic developed by Robert Bryant, a chemical engineer at Langley. LaRC-SI has excellent adhesive and dielectric properties and can be reformed at elevated temperature and pressures. It can be applied in the form of a spray, spin, dip coating, paint, or spread with a blade.\n      \n  \n  Medtronic is the world leader in medical technology providing lifelong solutions for people with chronic disease. It offers products, therapies, and services that enhance or extend the lives of millions of people. Each year, 6 million patients benefit from Medtronic’s technology, used to treat conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, neurological disorders, and vascular illnesses.\n  The company is testing the material for use as insulation on thin metal wires connected to its implantable cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) devices for patients experiencing heart failure, which resynchronize the contractions of the heart’s ventricles by sending tiny electrical impulses to the heart muscle, helping the heart pump blood throughout the body more efficiently. \n   “Our work with NASA Langley was very collaborative,” said Lonny Stormo, Medtronic vice president of therapy delivery research and development. “Our scientists discussed Medtronic’s material requirements and NASA shared what it knows about the compound’s properties as we continued our testing and evaluations.”\n  In March 2007, Medtronic conducted the first clinical implants in the United States and Canada of the Medtronic over-the-wire lead (Model 4196), a dual-electrode left ventricular (LV) lead for use in heart failure patients with cardiac resynchronization therapy devices. \n   “Through this partnership, Medtronic was able to deliver a product with enhanced material properties,” said Stormo. “In turn this helps our patients, which is the core of Medtronic’s mission.” \n  Placing a lead in the LV is widely recognized by physicians as the most challenging aspect of implanting CRT devices.

Some of the same mechanical design skill that made its way into the plans for rocket engines and advanced propulsion at this Alabama-based NASA center also worked its way into the design of an orthotic knee joint that is changing the lives of people with weakened quadriceps. \n  Partnership\n  \n    \n    \n      \n      \n        Designed for patients with weak or absent quadriceps and varying degrees of knee instability, this lightweight orthosis will allow patients to regain their mobility and assist them in a more energy-efficient ambulation.\n    \n  \n  Gary Horton, owner and operator of Horton’s Orthotic Lab Inc., in Little Rock, Arkansas, was visiting Marshall on unrelated business, when he unexpectedly received assistance with a knee brace he was designing. \n  He was attending a meeting at the Center, where, once the engineers learned he was an orthotist, they shared with him plans for several newly designed knee joints.\n  The particular design that caught his eye was one by Marshall employee, Neil Meyers, a mechanical engineer, who had developed a lockable joint with a hinge brake. \n  Horton licensed the technology from Marshall and then set about applying the design concept to a new type of orthotic, a knee that automatically unlocks during the swinging phase of walking, but then is able to reengage for stability upon heel strike. \n  Product Outcome\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n              The selectively lockable knee brace facilitates faster, less painful rehabilitation by allowing movement of the knee.\n    \n  \n  Horton left Marshall with the basic design of the lockable knee joint, but still needed several years of design, development, and testing before bringing the medical device to the market. \n  Horton contacted Arkansas Manufacturing Solutions (AMS), operating at the time as the Arkansas Manufacturing Extension Network, a program of the Arkansas Science and Technology Authority. AMS has been instrumental in helping hundreds of Arkansas manufacturers increase sales and profits by cutting costs and improving manufacturing processes by providing technical and management assistance that improves the quality, productivity, and global competitiveness of state businesses. Through AMS, Horton was connected with Professor John Hebard, of the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, who helped the orthotist overcome additional design obstacles.\n  In total, Horton spent 7 years perfecting the design of the knee joint. The result was the Stance Control Orthotic Knee Joint (SCOKJ). Designed for patients with weak or absent quadriceps and varying degrees of knee instability, it is ideal for people with weak quadricep muscles due to polio, spinal cord injuries, and other conditions; such as unilateral leg paralysis. The lightweight orthosis allows patients to regain their mobility and assist them in more energy-efficient ambulation.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n      The brace may be used by a patient recovering from a knee injury when the knee cannot carry the full weight of the patient.\n    \n  \n  Much like the human knee, the selectively lockable joint operates in three distinct but complementary modes: free motion or automatic stance control, for walking, and manual lock, for standing. The device locks the knee when the heel strikes, but then releases when the heel lifts off the ground, which provides the user with a normal gait, while also providing stability while standing. The stance control feature can be triggered by weight bearing or joint motion, according to patient needs. \n  The SCOKJ entered the commercial realm in 2002 as a very durable option for knee orthotics and has since helped thousands of people.\n  Stance Control Orthotic Knee™ is a trademark, and SCOKJ® is a registered trademark of Horton Technology Inc. \n    \n    \n    \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n    \n\n"},{"href":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/hm_6.html","text":"Robotic Joints Support Horses and Humans","image":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/images/hm_14.jpeg","story":"\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n  Health and Medicine\n  \n\n\n  Originating Technology/NASA Contribution\n  A rehabilitative device first featured in Spinoff 2003 is not only helping human patients regain the ability to walk, but is now helping our four-legged friends as well. The late James Kerley, a prominent Goddard Space Flight Center researcher, developed cable-compliant mechanisms in the 1980s to enable sounding rocket assemblies and robots to grip or join objects. In cable-compliant joints (CCJs), short segments of cable connect structural elements, allowing for six directions of movement, twisting, alignment, and energy damping. \n  Kerley later worked with Goddard’s Wayne Eklund and Allen Crane to incorporate the cable-compliant mechanisms into a walker for human patients to support the pelvis and imitate hip joint movement.\n  Partnership\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n                An equine patient is fitted with a specialized, flexible harness that supports the torso. \n    \n  \n  In June 2002, Enduro Medical Technology, of South Windsor, Connecticut, licensed NASA’s cable-compliant technology and walker, and modified them into an advanced walker with a specialized, flexible harness that supports the torso. This eliminated the need for physical support from a therapist. According to Kenneth Messier, Enduro’s president, the company “saw using this cable-compliant mechanism as a way to really improve and revolutionize how physical therapy is done for patients.” The company designed four versions of its Secure Ambulation Module (S.A.M.), a device which provides a stable environment for patients during ambulation therapy. Enduro also introduced electronic linear actuators to give medical staff the ability to adjust and control the weight bearing of each patient, and a digital readout to record settings and track progress. \n  Enduro further developed the adjustable patient harness system, introducing S.A.M. in March 2003. The pelvic harness comes in various sizes and is padded with NASA-developed temper foam for comfort. The S.A.M. is currently in use for injured veterans at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, in Washington, DC, and the Edward Hines Jr. Veterans Administration Hospital, in Chicago. Kindred Hospital, in Greensboro, North Carolina, is using an institutional S.A.M. for patients weighing up to 1,000 pounds.\n  Product Outcome\n  In response to a request from the veterinary community, Enduro engineers developed a rehabilitative device for horses using the CCJ-technology in S.A.M. Enduro secured a license from Goddard in February 2007, to develop the Enduro N.E.S.T. (NASA Equine Support Technology). Enduro believes the N.E.S.T. will revolutionize veterinary equine medicine, opening the possibility for life saving surgery in horses that otherwise may have been euthanized. Like the S.A.M., the N.E.S.T. can adjust for height and width, accommodating horses of different sizes, from smaller horses weighing 1,000 pounds to draft horses weighing 2,400 pounds. \n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n                The Enduro N.E.S.T. allows horses to remain standing during anesthesia or rehabilitation.\n    \n  \n  The N.E.S.T. reduces risk both before and after surgical procedures by supporting a horse’s weight. This also allows the anesthetized horse to remain upright, while traditional methods require the anesthetized horse be hoisted upside down by the legs for transportation into the surgical suite, which can cause a dangerous drop in the horse’s blood pressure. After surgery, horses need to stand as soon as possible after waking, since they cannot remain lying down for extended periods. When waking from anesthesia, horses are disoriented and unstable, frequently kicking and thrashing into the padded walls of their stall while attempting to stand. This frequently leads to broken limbs, concussions, and other injuries.\n  The only other options for a safer surgical recovery are padded recovery stalls and recovery pools, such as the one used for the racehorse Barbaro at the University of Pennsylvania. These treatments have drawbacks and are not appropriate for all cases: for instance, recovery pools require a large number of personnel and are expensive to build and maintain, and there are only two pools currently available in the United States for equine post-surgical recovery. These specially designed pools can cost over $1 million to construct; meanwhile, the N.E.S.T. will sell for $75,000 to $90,000. \n  A horse recovering from surgery in the N.E.S.T. is securely positioned in a natural standing position, which reduces complications, limits additional injuries to the horse, and protects both patients and staff from injury during and after procedures. “This equipment revolutionizes how horses recover from anesthesia immediately following surgery as well as allows long-term un-weighted rehabilitation,” said Messier. In the N.E.S.T., the horses remain calm, Messier explains. Conventional un-weighted therapies include underwater treadmills, rehabilitative swimming pools, and harnesses attached to permanent overhead lifts. With any water treatment, however, there is the potential for a dangerous infection if there are sutures from surgical procedures.\n  Traditionally, even after horses recover safely from surgery, they are still at risk of developing laminitis for months after an injury. One of most dangerous illnesses in horses, laminitis can occur when the “good” limb opposite the injured limb is forced to support too much weight. “The Enduro N.E.S.T. may help prevent the onset of this disease by selectively un-weighting different limbs,” says Messier, which is possible through the use of the cable-compliant joints developed at Goddard. The unit can balance weight individually for horses’ limbs instead of being weighted evenly or too heavily on one limb; Barbaro was eventually euthanized because of laminitis.\n  The N.E.S.T. can be used for extended periods of rehabilitation where the horse needs to stand in a controlled, secure environment. It can also be used at equine rehabilitation clinics, or brought to barns where the horses can be treated on site. Horses may even be able to reside permanently in the N.E.S.T. \n  Enduro continues to invest in further development and exploration of CCJ technology-based devices. A “Sit-To-Stand” version of S.A.M., also based on CCJ technology, is being used to help patients stand independently. The company has developed the S.A.M.-Y, a youth version for patients between 35 and 150 pounds and a maximum height of 5 feet 3 inches. Future Enduro plans call for the development of an adult home version of the S.A.M.\n  The S.A.M.™ and Enduro N.E.S.T.™ are trademarks of Enduro Inc.\n    \n  \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n    \n\n"},{"href":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/hm_7.html","text":"Photorefraction Screens Millions for Vision Disorders","image":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/images/R-D_thumb_opt.jpeg","story":"\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n     \n    Health and Medicine\n  \n\n\n  Originating Technology/NASA Contribution \n  Who would have thought that stargazing in the 1980s would lead to hundreds of thousands of schoolchildren seeing more clearly today? Collaborating with research ophthalmologists and optometrists, Marshall Space Flight Center scientists Joe Kerr and the late John Richardson adapted optics technology for eye screening methods using a process called photorefraction. Photorefraction consists of delivering a light beam into the eyes where it bends in the ocular media, hits the retina, and then reflects as an image back to a camera. A series of refinements and formal clinical studies followed their highly successful initial tests in the 1980s. \n  Evaluating over 5,000 subjects in field tests, Kerr and Richardson used a camera system prototype with a specifically angled telephoto lens and flash to photograph a subject’s eye. They then analyzed the image, the cornea and pupil in particular, for irregular reflective patterns. Early tests of the system with 1,657 Alabama children revealed that, while only 111 failed the traditional chart test, Kerr and Richardson’s screening system found 507 abnormalities.\n  Partnership\n  In 1991, NASA transferred the exclusive license for the system to the Vision Research Corporation (VRC), of Birmingham, Alabama, after Kerr sold his company to VRC. Jim Kennemer, VRC’s president, says the basic technology is still the same in 2008. “What makes this work is the optics, the distance, the angles, and the flash. We retained the basic optical principles.” \n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n              A specialist from the Vision Research Corporation (right) uses the VisiScreen to photograph a patient’s eyes at a specific distance and angle. Specialists at VRC later analyze the images and issue a report to the family or physician, indicating areas of possible concern.\n    \n  \n  Also in 1991, VRC began a two-pronged marketing effort for the VisiScreen Ocular Screening System-Clinical (OSS-C): sales to pediatricians and family practitioners, and the widespread distribution of screening services to school systems and other organizations with large numbers of children. That year, the Russell Corporation (based in Alexander City, Alabama, and now also in Atlanta) joined forces with VRC to conduct a large-scale eye-screening program in Russell’s employee daycare centers. In approximately 10 percent of the children, the program identified previously unsuspected vision problems significant enough to warrant follow-up examination by an eye care professional. Because several eye conditions can worsen and even cause blindness if not caught early, there were clear benefits in continuing the screenings.\n  The success of this program led Russell Corporation to collaborate with Alabama Power and the Alabama State Department of Education to sponsor a program for all kindergarten students in the state. “That was the first statewide eye screening program using advanced technology in the country,” Kennemer says. VRC also contributed to the growth of the nonprofit organization, Sight Savers of Alabama, to provide vision care and assistance to needy children. \n  VRC has since used VisiScreen to check over 3 million children in schools and daycare centers. “The NASA technology that has made our screening programs possible has truly changed the lives of hundreds of thousands of children,” Kennemer says. This impact is one of the reasons the Space Foundation inducted VisiScreen into the Space Technology Hall of Fame in 2003. \n  Product Outcome\n  Using photorefraction, VRC’s VisiScreen photographs a patient’s eyes at a specific distance and angle; light enters the eye, reflects off the retina, and returns an image to the screening system. Specialists at VRC later analyze the images and issue a report to the family or physician, indicating areas of possible concern.\n  Although not intended to replace examination by an eye care professional, VisiScreen can highlight possible problems that a child’s parents and teachers may not have noticed. The system can detect common childhood vision problems, including myopia (nearsightedness), hyperopia (farsightedness), astigmatism (corneal irregularities), strabismus (alignment errors), and cataracts, which occur in roughly 1 in every 1,000 infants.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n              Shown here, anisometropia is a condition in which a patient’s eyes have unequal refractive power. If not caught early enough, anisometropia can cause amblyopia, or lazy eye. Vision Research Corporation’s screening program has found over 3,000 children with indications of anisometropia.\n    \n  \n  VisiScreen tests the eye for refractive error and obstruction in the cornea or lens. The photorefractor analyzes the retinal reflexes generated by the subject’s response to the flash. If the eye is properly focusing the light, as happens in a child with normal vision, a smooth, clear “red eye” image of the retina reflects evenly from the pupils. For a child who is hyperopic, a bright half-moon reflects from the top of the pupil. In the case of myopia, a crescent in the bottom half of the eye reflects more brightly than the top. Similarly, other potential problem areas reflect differently than a properly focused eye would. \n  The system provides several major advantages over traditional vision screening with letter or picture charts: children do not need to respond during the test, so anyone, including an infant, can be screened regardless of age or verbal ability; the process is also as quick as taking a photograph, so screeners can process large numbers of patients rapidly. \n  Pediatricians and family doctors in over 20 states use VisiScreen to identify possible vision problems in children, who are then referred to ophthalmologists and optometrists for diagnosis and treatment. VRC screened approximately 150,000 Alabama elementary school students during the 2007-2008 school year, and continues to offer its services across the Southeast. According to Kennemer, “Over 3,000 had indications of a difference in the power of the eyes called anisometropia, which can indicate or lead to amblyopia.”\n  Commonly known as “lazy eye,” amblyopia can cause permanent vision loss in the weaker eye if not detected and corrected early enough; “it is the leading cause of preventable blindness in children,” Kennemer explains. Since its inception, VisiScreen has found amblyopic factors in over 70,000 children, or approximately 1 child in 40. “These screenings are vitally important,” Kennemer says, “because if children are not treated before age 6 or 7, they may suffer permanent vision loss; in addition, amblyopia leads to 17 percent of all adult total blindness. Although blindness is not a concern for most children in the screenings, limited vision can affect both social and educational development. A child who cannot see well is at an obvious disadvantage in the classroom, and those who fall behind early in their education are more likely to have additional problems later.”\n  Through the efforts of VRC and VisiScreen, NASA has improved the lives of hundreds of thousands of children whose eye problems may have remained undiagnosed or otherwise untreated.VRC is planning more improvements and enhancements to VisiScreen, and soon will begin field testing a new generation of the screening system.\n  VisiScreen® is a registered trademark of Vision Research Corporation.\n    \n    \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n      \n\n\n"},{"href":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/hm_8.html","text":"Periodontal Probe Improves Exams, Alleviates Pain","image":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/images/hm_18.jpeg","story":"\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n  Health and Medicine\n  \n\n\n  Originating Technology/NASA Contribution\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n                The USProbe device rides along the gum line, sending a signal down the pocket between the gums and teeth. Echoes are recorded by an ultrasound transducer and then analyzed by a computer system. A foot pedal is used to start the flow of water, read data, and then send the information to a computer where it is fed into a charting software program.\n    \n  \n  “Dentists,” comedian Bill Cosby memorably mused, “tell you not to pick your teeth with any sharp metal object. Then you sit in their chair, and the first thing they grab is an iron hook!” Conventional periodontal probing is indeed invasive, uncomfortable for the patient, and the results can vary greatly between dentists and even for repeated measurements by the same dentist. It is a necessary procedure, though, as periodontal disease is the most common dental disease, involving the loss of teeth by the gradual destruction of ligaments that hold teeth in their sockets in the jawbone. The disease usually results from an increased concentration of bacteria in the pocket, or sulcus, between the gums and teeth. These bacteria produce acids and other byproducts, which enlarge the sulcus by eroding the gums and the periodontal ligaments.\n  The sulcus normally has a depth of 1 to 2 millimeters, but in patients with early stages of periodontal disease, it has a depth of 3 to 5 millimeters. By measuring the depth of the sulcus, periodontists can have a good assessment of the disease’s progress. Presently, there are no reliable clinical indicators of periodontal disease activity, and the best available diagnostic aid, periodontal probing, can only measure what has already been lost. A method for detecting small increments of periodontal ligament breakdown would permit earlier diagnosis and intervention with less costly and time-consuming therapy, while overcoming the problems associated with conventional probing. \n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n                The first PC-based automated probe on the market, USProbe integrates with most charting systems and allows one person to conduct a periodontal probing diagnostic exam while recording the results.\n    \n  \n  The painful, conventional method for probing may be destined for the archives of dental history, thanks to the development of ultrasound probing technologies. The roots of ultrasound probes are in an ultrasound-based time-of-flight technique routinely used to measure material thickness and length in the Nondestructive Evaluation Sciences Laboratory at Langley Research Center. The primary applications of that technology have been for corrosion detection and bolt tension measurements (Spinoff 2005). This ultrasound measurement system was adapted to the Periodontal Structures Mapping System, invented at Langley by John A. Companion, under the supervision of Dr. Joseph S. Heyman. Support of the research and development that led to this invention was provided by NASA’s Technology Applications Engineering Program and by the Naval Institute for Dental and Biomedical Research, in Great Lakes, Illinois. In fact, a request from the U.S. Navy spurred the development of the tool: A sailor on a submarine had to be airlifted 1 month into a 6-month tour due to a life threatening case of periodontal disease, costing the Navy millions of dollars as the mission had to be abandoned. \n  Partnership\n  Patented as the Ultrasonagraphic Probe (USProbe) in May 1998, Visual Programs Inc., of Richmond, Virginia, obtained an exclusive license for the system in January 2000. According to John Senn, of Visual Programs, the new device may be one of the major steps forward in the battle against periodontal disease. “The probe should be the next major piece of dental equipment. By using the new technology, dentists and hygienists will be able to perform exams earlier and may detect periodontal disease while the teeth can still be saved.” According to Jack Singer, the president of Visual Programs, “The name NASA has opened many doors for us that may not have been opened otherwise. It gives credibility to a new concept that otherwise might not have been accepted.”\n  Product Outcome\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n                Much more comfortable than conventional probing, USProbe uses a slight flow of water to ensure coupling of ultrasound in and out of tissues.\n    \n  \n  The USProbe mapping system is a noninvasive tool to make and record differential measurements of a patient’s periodontal ligaments relative to a fixed point, the boundary between the crown and root of a tooth, called the cemento-enamel junction (CEJ). The mapping system uses ultrasound to detect the top of the ligaments at various points around each tooth, and uses either ultrasound or an optical method to find the CEJ at the same points. The depth of the sulcus is calculated as the difference between these two points. \n  The probe used in the mouth to send and receive ultrasound signals is very small, and additional instrumentation is contained within a standard personal computer, allowing the entire measurement to be computerized. In addition, manual charting of pocket depth will be eliminated, since the data will be automatically transmitted to the computer. In addition to solving the problems associated with conventional probing, the USProbe may also provide information on the condition of the gum tissue and the quality and extent of the bond to the tooth surface.\n  Visual Programs developed the USProbe as the next-generation, state-of-the-art diagnostic tool for detecting and characterizing periodontal disease. The USProbe automatically detects, maps, and diagnoses problem areas by integrating diagnostic medical ultrasound techniques with advanced artificial intelligence. Visual Programs expects it will quickly become the industry standard technique, replacing the current uncomfortable and invasive techniques.

Protein crystal growth, cell and tissue cultures, and separation technologies such as electrophoresis and magnetophoresis have been studied on Apollo 14, Apollo 16, STS-107, and many other missions. \n  Electrophoresis and magnetophoresis, respectively, are processes that separate substances based on the electrical charge and magnetic field of a molecule or particle. Electrophoresis has been studied on over a dozen space shuttle flights, leading to developments in electrokinetics, which analyzes the effects of electric fields on mass transport (atoms, molecules, and particles) in fluids. Further studies in microgravity will continue to improve these techniques, which researchers use to extract cells for various medical treatments and research.\n  Partnership\n  As part of the NASA Shuttle Student Involvement Program, John Vellinger designed an experiment to study the effect of low gravity on chicken embryos. After his freshman year at Purdue University in 1985, Vellinger partnered with KFC Corporation staff engineer, Mark Deuser, who helped Vellinger design the “Chix in Space” experiment for two space shuttle missions. Their work together laid the foundation for creating Space Hardware Optimization Technology Inc. (SHOT) in 1988, after acquiring a NASA contract for space flight hardware development. \n  Since 1988, four NASA centers—Marshall Space Flight Center, Glenn Research Center, Johnson Space Center, and Ames Research Center—have issued over 25 Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contracts to the Greenville, Indiana-based company, which has since changed its name to Techshot Inc. For its first 13 years, Techshot served exclusively as a NASA payload company, specializing in space hardware and later, separation technologies. Techshot engineers designed and integrated hardware for three suborbital rocket flights, seven space shuttle missions, and several payloads for the International Space Station. \n  Working with the Consortium for Materials Development in Space at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, Techshot won a contract to develop separation technologies for space application. Separation technologies involve the analysis and purification of proteins or “markers” which reveal information about diseases and the body. With the addition of Paul Todd as chief scientist in 2000, Techshot realized the value of terrestrial applications of separation technology, and explored experimental possibilities with Marshall and Johnson. \n  Product Outcome\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n              Techshot and IKOTech licensed and commercialized this Quadruple Magnetic Sorter, which uses magnetophoresis for cancer research and stem cell processes.\n    \n  \n  Accustomed to working with the exacting requirements for space payloads, Techshot took a logical step in commercializing separation technology for the equally strict medical field, beginning with an organic separator developed for the Organic Separation Experiment that first flew on STS-57. Next, the company developed advanced separators based on the Advanced Space Experiment Processor (ADSEP), operated in low gravity without using a centrifugal field. These technologies provide biphasic, electrophoretic, and magnetic separation capabilities. \n  During early development of these separators, Techshot found the number of cells collected was insufficient for the needs of the experiment, for example, in stem cell transplants. To remedy this, Techshot purchased the license for a magnetic separation technology from the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, already shown to produce enough cells for a stem cell transplant. The resulting system—Magsort—is a multistage electromagnetic separator for purifying cells and magnetic particles for a variety of research and medical uses, including stem cell research and cancer treatment, in a much more refined manner than previously possible. \n  A laboratory apparatus for separating particles (especially biological cells), Magsort separates cells based on their magnetic susceptibility and magnetophoretic mobility. Magsort refines a sample population of particles by categorizing multiple portions of the sample and separating substances into individual parts, instead of as entire sets. As Todd explains, “If you have a mixture of cells—A, B, C, and D—Magsort will separate and collect A and B and C and D and put them separately in the hands of a research investigator . . . . Other existing methods would sort out only B, for example.” \n  The cells of interest might only be present in low numbers, so refined separation techniques are necessary for effective research. In its magnetophoretic process, the Magsort creates magnetic particles that are smaller than the cell but react only to one certain cell type. The hematological stem cells, for example, have molecules on their surface (clusters of differentiation 34) that can react with an antibody and then attach to a magnetic particle. If the mixture is then placed in a magnetic field, only the stem cells will be drawn to the magnet.\n  Magsort includes an electronic unit coupled to a built-in computer and a processing unit that includes horizontal upper and lower plates, a plate rotation system, a graded series of capture magnets above the upper plate, and a wheel for sequencing the small permanent capture magnets. The bolted plates rotate, and an interface between them acts as a seal for separating fluids. Up to 15 upper cuvette stations allow for fraction collection; a stepping motor drives the rotation system, causing the upper plate to rotate for fractional sample collection.

A Techshot spinoff company, IKOTech LLC, is commercializing a version of the Magsort called the Quadruple Magnetic Sorter; it is used primarily for stem cell processes and cancer research and treatment, including the detection of rare cancer cells and the removal of undesired cells from bone marrow transplants. Another model is being developed for type 1 diabetes pancreas islet transplants. Todd explains, “Right now, it takes two or three donor organs to treat one person. Our process greatly increases the yield.” With enough healthy (transplanted) beta cells of their own, patients’ symptoms could vanish. \n  Techshot credits the success of their separation technologies with their years of experience with NASA, and consider the company itself a spinoff.

Electric vehicles (EVs), in particular, provide an attractive option as they produce no emissions during operation, isolating any potential emissions and effluents in the manufacturing and energy-generation streams. \n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n                Hybrid Technologies worked with Kennedy Space Center in the testing and development of its line of electric vehicles.\n    \n  \n  The necessary energy stores to support a shift to EVs already exist, as utilities constructed to address peak demands have off-peak surpluses sufficient to charge about 180 million plug-in hybrid or all-electric cars. According to a report from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, there is enough excess generating capacity during the night and morning to allow more than 80 percent of today’s vehicles to make the average daily commute solely using this electricity. Effective energy management sees its ultimate realization in the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) concept, in which plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles can be used to balance energy demand and consumption. In a V2G system, millions of automotive batteries could absorb excess power generated, and release it back into the grid at times of insufficient supply. With a several kilowatt-hour storage capacity per vehicle, millions of operational plug-ins could act as a safety net for the power grid, supplying backup power in an outage, with the vehicle owners credited for power returned to the grid. This smoothing of excess and deficiency in the power grid would also help stabilize intermittent sources of energy such as wind power and make them more viable alternatives.\n  Historically, the primary obstacles to the widespread application of EVs were lack of infrastructure development and a lack of sufficiently robust battery technologies to consistently power vehicles for an extended duration and at performance levels suitable to a modern urban environment. Technology may at last have caught up with the need, and rising petroleum prices are encouraging more and more consumers to consider electric and hybrid vehicles. In addition, a study by the U.S. Department of Transportation has indicated that plug-in cars capable of 50 miles per day would meet the needs of 80 percent of the American driving public, the average daily commuters. \n  NASA has taken a keen interest in battery-powered vehicles, and is encouraging their continued development. The “NASA Official Fleet Management Handbook,” regarding the use of alternative fueled vehicles, states: “Ideally, all Centers should have on-site alternative fuel facilities . . . . Centers are encouraged to use NEVs [Neighborhood Electric Vehicles] to fill inventory requirements where feasible.”\n  Partnership\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n                The EV MINI Cooper proudly displays its NASA heritage and boasts a range of 120 miles at 75 miles per hour.\n    \n  \n  Hybrid Technologies Inc., a manufacturer and marketer of lithium-ion battery-EVs, based in Las Vegas, Nevada, and with research and manufacturing facilities in Mooresville, North Carolina, entered into a Space Act Agreement with Kennedy Space Center to determine the utility of lithium-powered fleet vehicles. Under this agreement, the company supplied a fleet of cars for the engineers at Kennedy to test. In return for the engineering expertise supplied by the NASA employees, the Center was given the opportunity to use the zero-emission vehicles for transportation around the Kennedy campus. NASA contributed engineering expertise for the cars’ advanced battery management system, and vehicles selected for use in the Kennedy fleet included the Hybrid PT Cruiser, lithium smart fortwo, and a high-performance all-terrain vehicle. \n  The vehicles were powered by Ballard Power Systems’ 312V 67 MS electric drive system, which has a 32kW continuous rating and delivers a peak power of 67kW, with torque of 190 Nm (140 lb-ft). Hybrid Technologies selected this motor based on its proven track record and excellent power-to-weight ratio. The electric PT Cruisers have a top speed in excess of 80 miles per hour and a range of 120 miles. Charge time is 6-8 hours with either 110-120 V or 220-240V, and the lithium-ion battery pack has a cycle life of more than 1,500 charges.\n  In addition to the vehicles supplied to NASA, the company provided a fleet of lithium-ion battery-powered vehicles for use by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Navy.\n  Product Outcome\n  Hybrid Technologies deployed the first all-electric taxi in New York City and has begun demonstrating smart fortwo conversions like the ones used at Kennedy. The company also delivered an additional two PT Cruiser-based electric taxis and an electric Chrysler Town & Country minivan to the city of Sacramento for use by a private para-transit nonprofit organization. Most recently, Hybrid Technologies has produced an EV version of the popular MINI Cooper, which debuted in the December 2007 Sam’s Club catalog. The EV MINI Cooper proudly displays its NASA heritage, sharing the STS-128 designation with an upcoming Space Shuttle Endeavor mission. It boasts a range of 120 miles at 75 miles per hour, and is driven by a 40kW electric motor and powered by a 30kWh battery pack. The appeal of the electric MINI is strong and widespread, and Hybrid Technologies conversions have already attracted celebrity fans.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n                Hybrid Technologies offers the LiV series of purpose-built lithium electric vehicles, which also includes custom motorcycles, utility vehicles, and mobility scooters.\n    \n  \n  Also available from Sam’s Club, the 2007 Hybrid Technologies lithium-powered smart fortwo EV (also available as a limited edition STS-118 smart fortwo) has an estimated range of 150 miles, a top speed over 70 mph, and takes only 4 hours to charge at 220 volts. There are two electric motors that can be used in the vehicle, one from Ballard and one from Siemens VDO. The lithium polymer battery pack comes from Kokam America Inc., and the battery management system is Hybrid Technologies’ own. As an introductory offer, Sam’s Club included a behind-the-scenes trip to Kennedy and attendance at a space shuttle launch, with purchase of one of the EVs. When asked about the availability of amenities such as air conditioning and heating, comforts not always incorporated into EV conversions, Richard Griffiths, Strategic Relations for Hybrid Technologies, stated “The [smart fortwo EV] has absolutely every option, every feature that a regular, production smart car has.” Griffiths estimated the extra amenities consume about 5 percent of the vehicle’s battery capacity. “We’re offering the fully electric smart car to Sam’s Club members as it represents the latest in advanced lithium technology . . . . This limited edition STS-118 smart car will be the perfect addition for car collectors or the environmentalist wanting to make a difference by driving a zero emissions vehicle.” In addition to the MINI Cooper and smart fortwo conversions, Hybrid Technologies offers PT Cruiser and Chrysler Crossfire EV conversions.\n  Even more impressive than its line of conversions, Hybrid Technologies now also offers a series of purpose-built lithium electric vehicles dubbed the LiV series. The LiV series is designed from the ground up at Hybrid Technologies’ Mooresville plant. The LiV Wise is aimed at the urban and commuter environments, and is larger and offers more interior space than the smart car, the conversion of which is called the LiV Dash. Hybrid Technologies has rounded out the LiV line with custom motorcycles, utility vehicles, mobility scooters, bicycles, and even a military vehicle. Hybrid Technologies plans to offer these vehicles to the U.S. market on a wider scale by 2009, and is especially focused on developing a system that will seamlessly integrate LiV Wise cars in small markets by 2009 and mass markets by 2010.\n  LiV™, Wise™, and Dash™ are trademarks of Hybrid Technologies Inc.\n  MINI Cooper® is a registered trademark of Bayerische Motoren Werke AG.\n  PT Cruiser®, Town & Country®, and Crossfire® are registered trademarks of Chrysler Corporation.\n  smart® and fortwo® are registered trademarks of Daimler AG.\n\n\n\n\n\n                      \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                      \n                      "},{"href":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/t_2.html","text":"Advanced Control System Increases Helicopter Safety","image":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/images/t-4.jpeg","story":"\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n  Transportation\n  \n\n\n  Originating Technology/NASA Contribution\n  For over 30 years, NASA and U.S. Army engineers have worked together at Ames Research Center to make rotorcraft fly more quickly, quietly, and safely in all kinds of weather. Development of new technologies for both military and civil helicopters, tiltrotor aircraft, and other advanced rotary-wing aircraft has engaged disparate parties from all corners of the rotorcraft industry, the U.S. Department of Defense, and other government agencies. These programs have focused on all manner of helicopter components:\n  \n    \n      Cockpit controls: Cockpit layout and design can profoundly affect the ease or difficulty of piloting a rotorcraft.\n    \n    \n      Handling and performance: NASA and Army experts design flight control systems which make helicopters and other rotorcraft easier to fly using a full-motion simulator and actual aircraft.\n    \n    \n      Noise: Most rotorcraft noise results from vibrating parts and the interaction of air vortices shed from the tips of the rotors. Researchers use wind tunnels to investigate ways to reduce noise.\n    \n    \n      Speed and performance: Airflow around the fuselage and moving rotor blades is very complex. These complexities limit the helicopter’s speed in moving in different directions. Ames researchers use wind tunnels and computers to investigate ways to improve the airflow. \n    \n  \n  Particularly focused on safe rotorcraft operation, NASA’s Safe All-Weather Flight Operations for Rotorcraft (SAFOR) element of the Rotorcraft Research and Technology Base Program was specifically tasked with improving the safety of civil helicopter operations. SAFOR ran from 1999 through 2002 and focused on improving drive systems technology, flight control and guidance technology, and situational awareness and information display technologies. \n  The drive systems element sought to reduce the frequency and consequences of main and tail rotor, transmission, drive, clutch, gearbox, and drive system failures by improving reliability of drive systems. The flight control segment included work to reduce the frequency and severity of accidents due to loss of control, high workload, and exceeding vehicle limits. The situational awareness and information displays unit pursued reduced frequency and severity of accidents due to pilot error, inexperience, poor judgment, lack of situational awareness, and inadequate preparation. SAFOR led to many improvements in helicopter design and operation, some of which have already reached the commercial market.\n   Partnership\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n                Preset attitude retention limits in the HeliSAS prevent inadvertent cyclic inputs that could result in an unusual attitude.\n    \n  \n  Hoh Aeronautics Inc. (HAI), of Lomita, California, was founded in 1988 and is dedicated to the analysis and development of conventional and advanced flight control systems and displays for fixed and rotary wing aircraft. HAI engineers also evaluate and develop handling qualities criteria, piloted simulations and flight-test programs, and computer-based training programs. \n  With support and funding from a Phase II NASA Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project from Ames, HAI produced a low-cost, lightweight, attitude-command-attitude-hold stability augmentation system (SAS) for use in civil helicopters and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The primary advantage of the SAS is that, by increasing helicopter stability and allowing hands-free operation of the aircraft, the system helps the pilot to accomplish divided attention tasks. SAS improves helicopter dynamics and enhances safety in low-speed and hovering maneuvers in degraded visual environments, and for Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) operations in forward flight. As opposed to Visual Flight Rules (VFR), IFR operation of the vehicle references only the instruments and Air Traffic Control, allowing operation in conditions that obscure the pilot’s view; most commercial air traffic operates exclusively under IFR. \n  The prototype helicopter autopilot/stability augmentation system, dubbed HeliSAS, weighed 12 pounds, significantly less than comparable systems, which can weigh over 50 pounds. HeliSAS proved its superior performance in over 160 hours of flight testing and demonstrations in a Robinson R44 Raven helicopter, one of the most popular commercial helicopters and a particular favorite of news broadcasting and police operations. The HeliSAS reduced pilot workload and increased safety by allowing hands-off flight, and as an added bonus, the system cost significantly less than current systems that perform the same functions.\n  By offering significant stability and control improvements in a low-cost/lightweight system, HeliSAS promises many benefits in space, military, and civilian aviation applications, including: \n  \n    \n      Improving the stability of light helicopters at an affordable cost without excessive weight penalty\n    \n    \n      Increasing feasibility of low-cost UAVs \n    \n    \n      Potentially developing dual-role, low-cost utility helicopter/UAVs, which can be flown with or without a pilot\n    \n  \n  Product Outcome\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n                HeliSAS provides unmatched stability and ease of handling, including “hands near” operation while maintaining heading or navigation course and attitude—even during turbulent conditions.\n    \n  \n  HAI developed HeliSAS into a superior stability augmentation system for light helicopters. With the push of a button, the HeliSAS converts the R44 Raven from an unstable aircraft with very light stick forces to a highly stable platform with enhanced control feel that provides force feedback to the pilot—in effect, HeliSAS makes the R44 feel like a much larger, more stable helicopter. With the system engaged, it is possible for the pilot to remove his or her hand from the cyclic to fold charts or perform other cockpit duties, and the R44 has been demonstrated to hold attitude indefinitely with the HeliSAS engaged. A full autopilot option has been added, including altitude hold, heading select/hold, VHF Omni-directional Radio Range Localizer (VOR/LOC) track, Instrument Landing System (ILS) track, and Global Positioning System (GPS) steering. \n   Shawn Coyle, an instructor at the National Test Pilot School, a not-for-profit educational institute incorporated in California, and former Civil Aviation Authority certification pilot in Canada, conducted a flight evaluation of the HeliSAS, and the system has been featured in Helicopter World magazine’s “North American Special Report 2004” (published in the United Kingdom). \n  Chelton Flight Systems, of Boise, Idaho, negotiated with HAI to develop, market, and manufacture HAI’s HeliSAS autopilot system, and the product is now available as the Chelton HeliSAS Digital Helicopter Autopilot.\n  HeliSAS™ is a trademark of Hoh Aeronautics Inc.\n    \n    \n    \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n    \n\n"},{"href":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/t_3.html","text":"Aerodynamics Research Revolutionizes Truck Design","image":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/images/t-6.jpeg","story":"\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n  Transportation\n  \n\n\n  Originating Technology/NASA Contribution\n  The last 35 years have seen a sea change in the design of trucks on America’s highways, reflecting extensive research into vehicle aerodynamics and fluid dynamics conducted by NASA engineers. Thanks to the ingenuity of a Dryden Flight Research Center researcher bicycling through the California desert and a team of engineers in Virginia, the shape of rigs and recreational vehicles (RVs) today owes as much to the skies as it does the open road. \n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n                Dryden engineers modified a retired delivery van to test aerodynamic drag, first boxing the van with aluminum sheets at 90-degree angles, and then rounding the sides and fashioning a boat-tail rear.\n    \n  \n  Bicyclists, motorcyclists, and even pedestrians feel a push and pull of air as large trucks pass. The larger a vehicle is and the faster it moves, the more air it pushes ahead. For a large truck, this can mean a particularly large surface moving a large quantity of air at a high velocity—its blunt face acting like a fast-moving bulldozer, creating a zone of high pressure. The displaced air must go somewhere, spilling around the cab into swirling vortices. The air traveling along the side moves unevenly, adhering and breaking away, and sometimes dissipating into the surrounding air. At the end of the cab or trailer, the opposite effect of the high-pressure zone at the front develops; the airflow is confronted with an abrupt turn that it cannot negotiate, and a low-pressure zone develops. \n  The high pressure up front, the turbid air alongside and under the vehicle, and the low pressure at the back all combine to generate considerable aerodynamic drag. A study published in Automotive Engineering in August 1975 found that a tractor trailer unit moving at 55 miles per hour displaced as much as 18 tons of air for every mile traveled. In such cases, roughly half of the truck’s horsepower is needed just to overcome aerodynamic drag.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n                A cab over engine tractor trailer was leased by Dryden, tested, and modified to reduce aerodynamic drag.\n    \n  \n  In 1973, Edwin J. Saltzman, Dryden aerospace engineer and bicyclist, noticed the push and pull of large trucks at highway speeds while riding to work. As a tractor trailer overtook him, he first felt the bow wave of air pushing him slightly away from the road and toward the sagebrush; as the truck swept past, its wake had the opposite effect, drawing him toward the road and even causing both rider and bicycle to lean toward the lane. Saltzman mused about ways to mitigate the bow wave and trailing partial vacuum, and resolved to help trucks glide through air instead of push through it, and, in the process, decrease drag and increase fuel efficiency. NASA colleagues at Dryden were working on the effects of drag and wind resistance on different kinds of aircraft and the early space shuttle designs, so they transferred their considerable knowledge to the design of large trucks. \n  The first formal experiment involved a Ford van retired from delivery duties at Dryden. Mechanics attached an external frame which was then covered with sheet aluminum to give the van flat sides all around and 90-degree angles at all corners. The vehicle looked like an aluminum shoebox on wheels, simulating the cruder motor homes of the period. The Dryden engineers measured the vehicle’s baseline drag and then set about modifying the shape of the van: First rounding the front vertical corners, then the bottom and top edges of the front, then the edges of the aft end, and finally sealing the entire underbody of the van including the wheel wells, with tests run after each modification. Rounding all four front edges yielded a 52-percent drag reduction, while sealing the bottom of the vehicle gained another 7 percent. The engineers estimated the potential gain in fuel economy to be between 15 and 25 percent at highway speeds. \n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n                Airtabs create controlled, counter-rotating vortices to bridge the gap between tractor and trailer or control airflow past the rear of the vehicle.\n    \n  \n  During the following decade, Dryden researchers conducted numerous tests to determine which adjustments in the shape of trucks reduced aerodynamic drag and improved efficiency. The team leased and modified a cab over engine (COE) tractor trailer, the dominant cab design of the time, from a Southern California firm. Modifications included rounding the corners and edges of the box-shaped cab with sheet metal, placing a smooth fairing on the cab’s roof, and extending the sides back to the trailer. \n  Rounding the vertical corners on the front and rear of the cab reduced drag by 40 percent while decreasing internal volume by only 1.3 percent. Likewise, rounding the vertical and horizontal corners cut drag by 54 percent, with a 3-percent loss of internal volume. Closing the gap between the cab and the trailer realized a significant reduction in drag and 20 to 25 percent less fuel consumption. A second group of tests added a faired underbody and a boat tail, the latter feature resulting in drag reduction of about 15 percent. Assuming annual mileage of 100,000 driven by an independent trucker, these drag reductions would translate to fuel savings of as much as 6,829 gallons per year.\n  On the other coast from Saltzman and his Dryden team, Dr. John C. Lin and Floyd G. Howard of Langley Research Center with Dr. Gregory V. Selby of Old Dominion University, Norfolk, Virginia, conducted a series of research projects in the late 1980s and early 1990s focusing on controlling drag and the flow of air around a body. One study conducted in 1989, “Turbulent Flow Separation Control,” explored controlling airflow—flow separation—to decrease energy expenditure and weight in airfoils, inlets, and diffusers and improve aircraft control and decrease drag. The study employed vortex generators, aerodynamic surfaces protruding from a body that draw faster moving air to the surface of the vehicle and disrupt the slower moving boundary layer air around a vehicle, the use of which can be traced back to research conducted by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NASA’s forebear) in the 1950s. The generated vortices “energize” the slower-moving boundary layer and thereby reduce drag and, in aircraft applications, increase lift.\n  Subsequent studies in 1990 and 1991 continued vortex-generator research with an exploration of various active and passive methods for controlling two-dimensional separated flow. These studies quantified and characterized the behavior and performance of a variety of large-eddy breakup devices for turbulent flow separation control. \n  Partnership\n  Answering the charge given by the U.S. Congress in the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 to disseminate newfound technologies and discoveries to the public, NASA makes the results of its research and expertise of its scientists and engineers available through a variety of means. Sponsored by the Innovative Partnerships Program, these include published studies, NASA outreach, the Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer programs, technology transfer offices at each NASA field center, and the Space Alliance Technology Outreach Program (SATOP). \n  The aerodynamics studies at Dryden have been made publicly available, and Aeroserve Technologies Ltd., of Ottawa, Canada, with its marketing arm, Airtab LLC, in Loveland, Colorado, applied these studies, the aerodynamic work at Langley, and the patented Wheeler vortex generator to the development of the Airtab vortex generator; designed to reduce drag and improve vehicle stability and fuel economy. Of the devices tested, the Wheeler showed the least parasitic drag, and Aeroserve optimized the Wheeler design for ease of installation and application to any vehicle. \n  Product Outcome\n  The Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 required states to permit trucks with trailers as long as 48 feet on both interstate and intrastate highways; the previous length limit of 55 feet had applied to the tractor and trailer together. As the previous regulation made the COE tractor a dominant choice, owing to its decreased length regardless of aerodynamic or fuel efficiency shortcomings, the new regulations opened the door for a renaissance of the “conventional” cab. While COE designs place the cab directly above the engine, minimizing length and producing a cube-like tractor, conventional truck designs place the engine ahead of the cab. Though longer as a result, a protruding nose offers truck designers an inherently more aerodynamic shape from which to work. In 1982, COE trucks constituted over 65 percent of the market for the Peterbilt Motors Company, with similar numbers for other manufacturers; the cab-over design represented only 1 percent of sales for Peterbilt by 2004. \n  Streamlined cabs and fairings are now a common sight on our highways, and the once-prominent cab-over design has been abandoned in virtually all applications except small-capacity urban-oriented trucks where length remains a premium. The modifications tried by the engineers at Dryden were adopted by the truck manufacturers, as the same principles the NASA engineers demonstrated with COE trucks applied to conventionals. In addition, the cargo boxes of most delivery trucks today have rounded corners and edges, a direct application of the research conducted at Dryden on the “shoebox.” \n  Today’s trailers, on the other hand, are little changed from the last few decades. For livestock haulers, a key factor is that individual farmers have been the predominant owners of trailers, and these owners are difficult to convince about the costs of redesign versus the savings of superior aerodynamics. However, more and more livestock trailers are sporting boat-tail designs that ease the flow of air past the end of the trailer and minimize the low-pressure wake. Conventional trailer manufacturers have resisted change more so than others, in part because the aft end of such a trailer needs to be easy to manipulate at loading docks, where the optimal shape for superior aerodynamics—the boat tail—is impractical. \n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n                Effective on any vehicle with more than a 30-degree slope to the rear, Airtabs see many applications in addition to trucks.\n    \n  \n  Likewise, the gap between the cab and the trailer can create a significant amount of drag as air swirls in the space between. Two conventional means to address this issue are problematic: Adding side extenders (to decrease the exposed gap) is expensive and might impede maneuverability; moving the fifth wheel forward (to shorten the gap) places more weight on the steering axle—which is legally regulated and limited—and reduces maneuverability while increasing driver effort and wear on steering tires and steering gear.\n  Addressing both of these dilemmas, Aeroserve’s Airtabs garner the benefits of the airflow found in a boat-tail design with the practicality of a squared-off end for loading and unloading, and see additional applicability smoothing the airflow between cab and trailer. Airtab vortex generators create a controlled vortex to reduce truck and trailer wind resistance and aerodynamic drag. Each Airtab produces two counter-rotating vortices of air, each approximately four to five times the height of the Airtab and several feet in length, that smoothly bridge the gap between tractor and trailer or control airflow past the rear of the vehicle. Airtabs thus allow an operator to set the fifth wheel to the optimum position without incurring extra drag or steering gear wear penalties and gain some of the aerodynamic benefit of side extenders. \n  At the back of a trailer, box van, or RV, Airtabs radically alter the airflow to reduce drag in two ways: Shifting the airflow pattern from vertical to horizontal to eliminate large eddies, and smoothing the airflow to artificially simulate a tapered rear of the vehicle. In fact, Airtabs have been shown effective on any vehicle with more than a 30-degree slope to the rear; the potential benefits stretch across vehicular applications and could thus benefit a considerable number of vehicles.\n  Smoothing the airflow results in markedly improved fuel economy without compromise to design utility, and additional benefits have been realized as well. The vortex generation reduces spray; users have reported improved rear and side view in wet or snowy weather, increasing safety and offering a clearer view of surrounding vehicles. Also, because Airtabs alter the airflow around the rear of a vehicle, the accumulation of road grime is reduced, keeping tail lights and reflectors clean and allowing less snow to build up, a significant safety benefit in foul weather. Less accumulation of road grime also means advertising and safety information on the back of a vehicle remains visible.\n  Perhaps most importantly, drivers of vehicles fitted with Airtabs have reported improved stability and handling and dramatically reduced fishtailing of trailers—an effect where the trailer sways or slides from side to side independent of the tractor, potentially causing catastrophic loss of control—effects that are especially important with the double trailers found in North America and the famous quad-trailer “road trains” in Australia. Increased stability also means that the trailer does not scrub on the sides of the road as much, increasing the life of tires. Drivers also report better handling when being passed in the same direction by other large vehicles. \n  Cummins Rocky Mountain LLC, a diesel engine and generator wholesale and distribution company in Broomfield, Colorado, recognized these benefits and agreed to promote and sell Airtabs after internal testing and customer feedback indicated that Airtabs brought immediate safety and fuel economy benefits when running equipment at highway speeds. The company noted additional benefits included ease of installation, minimal maintenance, and low price.\n  As more NASA research and development is adapted and introduced to the market by companies like Aeroserve, the vehicles populating our highways and interstates will likewise continue to evolve. Practical solutions to aerodynamic challenges, exemplified by the Airtab, offer increased stability, safety, and economy to airborne and surface vehicles alike, and NASA is proud to contribute tangible and current benefits to both fields of transport and travel.\n  Airtab® is a registered trademark of Aeroserve Technologies Ltd.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                      \n                      "},{"href":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/t_4.html","text":"Engineering Models Ease and Speed Prototyping","image":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/images/t-10.jpeg","story":"\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n  Transportation\n\n\n  Originating Technology/NASA Contribution\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n                LMS system-response models were used to calculate side-wall loads for the J-2X rocket nozzles, easing NASA’s development and offering LMS engineers a unique opportunity to gather data.\n    \n  \n  NASA astronauts plan to return to the Moon as early as 2015 and establish a lunar base, from which 6-month flights to Mars would be launched by 2030. Essential to this plan is the Ares launch vehicle, NASA’s next-generation spacecraft that will, in various iterations, be responsible for transporting all equipment and personnel to the Moon, Mars, and beyond for the foreseeable future.\n  The Ares launch vehicle is powered by the J-2X propulsion system, with what will be the world’s largest rocket nozzles. One of the conditions that engineers carefully consider in designing rocket nozzles—particularly large ones—is called separation phenomenon, which occurs when outside ambient air is sucked into the nozzle rim by the relatively low pressures of rapidly expanding exhaust gasses. This separation of exhaust gasses from the side-wall imparts large asymmetric transverse loads on the nozzle, deforming the shape and thus perturbing exhaust flow to cause even greater separation. The resulting interaction can potentially crack the nozzle or break actuator arms that control thrust direction.\n  Side-wall loads are extremely difficult to measure directly, and, until now, techniques were not available for accurately predicting the magnitude and frequency of the loads. NASA researchers studied separation phenomenon in scale-model rocket nozzles, seeking to use measured vibration on these nozzle replicas to calculate the unknown force causing the vibrations. Key to this approach was the creation of a computer model accurately representing the nozzle as well as the test cell.\n  Partnership\n  System-response models developed by LMS International NV were used to calculate side-wall loads on the J-2X nozzles. LMS is a Belgium-based company founded in 1980 with over 30 offices around the world, which acts as an engineering innovation partner for companies in automotive, aerospace, and other advanced manufacturing industries. LMS works with customers to improve process efficiency and product quality by offering a unique combination of virtual simulation software, testing systems, and engineering services.\n  LMS Virtual.Lab, an integrated suite of simulation software, developed the system-response models based on modal data on nozzle replicas from LMS Test.Lab, a software solution for test-based engineering combining high-speed multichannel data acquisition with a suite of integrated testing, analysis, and report-generation tools. Tests were conducted by the Marshall Space Flight Center Structural Dynamics Test Branch, which uses LMS Test.Lab in modal testing for a wide range of projects.\n  The close integration between LMS Test.Lab and LMS Virtual.Lab means data is readily available without file conversions, which often fail to fully represent critical data, such as frequency response functions (FRFs). Utilizing test data in combination with modeling and predictive tools in this type of hybrid approach will enable engineers to more accurately determine transverse separation forces and design nozzles to better withstand operational loads. Marshall also uses LMS Test.Lab for ground vibration testing (GVT) of the new vehicles.\n  Preparations are underway for GVT of the complete Ares I craft to be conducted in 2011 using the dynamic test stand at Marshall. Tests will be performed on the “full stack,” or the complete vehicle, including the first and second stage motors, fuel tanks, and crew capsule. Structural vibrations will be induced using up to six hydraulic or electrodynamic shakers delivering random and sine excitations. LMS Test.Lab can provide engineers with critical test data including FRFs, natural frequencies, damping values, and mode shapes to evaluate how the structure will likely vibrate during liftoff, stage separation, and subsequent phases of the flight.\n  The LMS SCADAS 260-channel front-end is also one of NASA’s large modal data-acquisition systems. The high channel count enables the modal test measurements in fewer test runs. Measuring multiple functions simultaneously allows them to obtain FRFs as well as associated cross spectrums, auto powers, and time data in parallel instead of having to run separate tests. The modal test team plans to complete the Ares GVT in only three test sets versus up to eight runs needed for comparable tests on the Saturn and shuttle vehicles using a system with far fewer channels. \n  The team also makes extensive use of LMS PolyMAX software, which automatically highlights resonances and provides consistent results that could otherwise vary due to subjective interpretation. In addition, animated operational deflection shape features show how the structure may bend and twist at various frequencies so engineers have deeper insight into dynamic structural behavior.\n  LMS is focused on the mission critical performance attributes in key manufacturing industries, including structural integrity, system dynamics, handling, safety, reliability, comfort, and sound quality. From this work, LMS engineers gained knowledge that will help develop tomorrow’s rocket propulsion systems and can also be used for engineering applications in a wide range of other industries. By providing onsite support for tests, the LMS technical support and development staff seize opportunities like the work with NASA to expand their knowledge of tests and dynamics in real-world applications. \n  Product Outcome\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n                LMS software and data-acquisition hardware help test, analyze, and optimize a vehicle’s ability to withstand the vibration loads experienced during missions.\n    \n  \n  As the pool of companies and agencies testing rockets is limited, knowledge related to the execution and optimization of design resulting from such tests is likewise small. Exposure to this data will lead to better modeling and simulation, resulting in better and safer products for the public. This approach of creating system models based on modal test data is useful in research and development studies of similar structures that are difficult to model and whose dynamic behavior is of primary interest. By working with NASA, LMS engineers gained access to uncommon test data to enhance and refine their product to help companies test future processes and designs. \n  In one recent example of the benefit of amalgamating experiences into an integrated platform, the Spanish division of the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company, Construcciones Aeronáuticas S.A. (EADS-CASA), also Spain’s leading aeronautical company, implemented LMS Test.Lab and PolyMAX tools to accelerate its ground vibration testing. This aircraft testing process included a series of tests to detect the aircraft resonances as a verification of the aircraft safety and reliability before the first actual test flights. Overall, the LMS Test.Lab GVT solution and the successful deployment and technology transfer project allowed EADS-CASA to realize considerable savings in time and resources on the Airbus A330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport project.\n  LMS computer simulation and modeling expertise has also been applied to motorcycle safety and stability. Engineers at BMW Motorrad employed LMS DADS mechanical system simulation software to create virtual prototypes of vehicles and mechanical systems. While LMS DADS included a tire model, motorcycle tires can roll up to 50 degrees, creating forces not captured in the conventional model. BMW engineers used the program’s open architecture to write in two subroutines to measure wobble, weave, and kickback. The first subroutine modeled throttle, brake, and handlebar inputs by a virtual rider. The second modeled tires and their interaction with the pavement, including variables for the frame; lower and upper forks; Telelever, a front suspension design unique to BMW motorcycles; front and rear wheels; rear swing arm; and other components. This model proved remarkably accurate in evaluating motorcycle design—engineers consider the simulation results at least as accurate as measurements taken on the test track, but with less invested time and expense. BMW is now able to specify structural design requirements, such as stiffness and mass distribution, which will ensure greater stability and safety of the end product.\n  Test.Lab®, Virtual.Lab®, SCADAS®, and PolyMAX® are registered trademarks of LMS International NV.\n  Telelever™ is a trademark of BMW AG Motorrad.\n\n\n\n\n\n                      \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                      \n                      "},{"href":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/t_5.html","text":"Software Performs Complex Design Analysis","image":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/images/t-12.jpeg","story":"\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n  Transportation\n\n\n  Originating Technology/NASA Contribution\n  Designers use computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to gain greater understanding of the fluid flow phenomena involved in components being designed. They also use finite element analysis (FEA) as a tool to help gain greater understanding of the structural response of components to loads, stresses and strains, and the prediction of failure modes. \n  Automated CFD and FEA engineering design has centered on shape optimization, which has been hindered by two major problems: 1) inadequate shape parameterization algorithms, and 2) inadequate algorithms for CFD and FEA grid modification. \n  Working with software engineers at Stennis Space Center, a NASA commercial partner, Optimal Solutions Software LLC, was able to utilize its revolutionary, one-of-a-kind arbitrary shape deformation (ASD) capability—a major advancement in solving these two aforementioned problems—to optimize the shapes of complex pipe components that transport highly sensitive fluids. \n  The ASD technology solves the problem of inadequate shape parameterization algorithms by allowing the CFD designers to freely create their own shape parameters, therefore eliminating the restriction of only being able to use the computer-aided design (CAD) parameters. \n  The problem of inadequate algorithms for CFD grid modification is solved by the fact that the new software performs a smooth volumetric deformation. This eliminates the extremely costly process of having to remesh the grid for every shape change desired. The program can perform a design change in a markedly reduced amount of time, a process that would traditionally involve the designer returning to the CAD model to reshape and then remesh the shapes, something that has been known to take hours, days—even weeks or months—depending upon the size of the model. \n  Partnership\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n                With traditional design software, reshaping an object can be a very tedious job, requiring point-by-point adjustment of hundreds or thousands of grid points. Sculptor makes this process simple and intuitive. \n    \n  \n  Optimal Solutions Software (OSS) LLC, of Provo, Utah, and Idaho Falls, Idaho, creates highly innovative engineering design improvement products to enable engineers to more reliably, creatively, and economically design new products in high-value markets. \n  The company entered into a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contract with Stennis, under which it extensively used its ASD software to improve pressure loss, velocity, and flow quality in the pipes utilized by NASA. The product is available under the trade name Sculptor.\n  Because of the funding from the SBIR program and the technical contributions from its NASA counterparts, OSS was able to take the technological know-how and commercial successes gained from this project and effectively commence the next-phase step into the marketplace. \n  According to Mark Landon, OSS’s president, “We thoroughly enjoyed working with the engineers and scientists at Stennis—they were technically very sound and extremely helpful in every aspect of the success of the project. Additionally, with the technical and funding assistance from this program, OSS was able to create new jobs, our revenue figures and sales have increased, and private investors are looking at us at this time to take us to the next stage on our road to commercialization.”\n  Implementing Sculptor’s ASD technology and optimizer during the Stennis SBIR Phase II test case, OSS demonstrated a steady-state optimized resistance temperature device (RTD), which produced a smaller and more symmetrical wake, resulting in a lower drag coefficient, thus a lower moment at the base of the RTD. Remarkably, because of the aerodynamic drag reduction from the shape optimization, there was a 60 percent reduction in moment at the base of the RTD probe.\n  NASA applications for Sculptor include the design of spacecraft shapes; aircraft shapes; propulsion devices (nozzles, combustion chambers, etc.); pumps; valves; fittings; and other components. \n  With the assistance from programs such as the SBIR program, the company continues to expand its product family and add features so that its customers can create breakthrough designs and realize increased efficiency gains.\n  Product Outcome \n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n              Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is proving an effective method for testing racecars—replacing, in some instances, the traditional track and wind tunnel tests. \n    \n  \n  Sculptor can be applied to almost any fluid dynamics problem, structural analysis problem, acoustics design, electromagnetic design, or any area where the designer needs to be able to address complex design analysis. The program performs smooth volumetric deformation and can institute design changes in seconds. \n  OSS has sold a license for Sculptor to Eglin Air Force Base for the design of unmanned aircraft drones and miniature aircraft. The company has also sold a license for the software to the U.S. Navy for use with Combustion Research and Flow Technology Inc., the author of the CRUNCH CFD code, a multi-element, unstructured flow solver for viscous, real gas systems, currently in use for cavitation modeling, turbo machinery applications, and large eddy simulation. \n  OSS has also teamed with Engineous Software Inc., the author of the iSIGHT optimization software, to subcontract on a Phase I SBIR with Wright-Patterson Air Force Base to use Sculptor to provide the shape deformation and shape matching for fluid structure interaction solutions. Wright-Patterson has also purchased a Sculptor license for application to aircraft shape design. \n  Since Sculptor can be utilized in any instance where there is fluid (gas or liquid) flowing in, around, or through an object, the applications are nearly countless. \n  Automotive shapes and parts such as aerodynamics of the body itself, mirrors, internal flow components such as intake manifolds, radiators, exhaust manifolds, cylinders, and air conditioning ducts all benefit from this program.\n  The motor sports industry is currently a big customer, with many racing teams finding a competitive edge by using Sculptor to reduce drag, improve down forces, improve engine design, and perform other design analyses, such as for brake cooling, basic flow handling, and internal combustion components. \n  \n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n      CFD shows pressure and streamlines along the body of this Aston Martin DBR9 GT series racecar.\n    \n  \n  Other sports are showing a deep interest in the Sculptor technology for such activities as golf club design, swimming and boating aerodynamics—even model airplane flight efficiencies.\n  Also showing great promise for using these tools are other industries such as biomedicine, which can utilize its ability to more quickly predict the effect of shape (anatomical) changes in the body’s vascular and other bodily systems. \n  To expand its domestic and worldwide presence, OSS has established a powerful distribution network, which covers North America, all of the European Union, Japan, South Korea, and China.\n  Sculptor™ is a trademark of Optimal Solutions Software LLC. \n  Crunch CFD® is a registered trademark of Combustion Research and Flow Technology Inc.\n  iSIGHT™ is a trademark of Engineous Software Inc.\n    \n    \n    \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n      \n\n\n"},{"href":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/ps.html","text":" Public Safety","image":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/images/Spinoff_-Nav.gif","story":"\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n \n\n\n  NASA makes our world safer.

Creating devices for the high-stress rigors of space travel pushes designers to their limits, and the results often far exceed the original concepts. The technologies developed for the extreme environment of space are often applicable here on Earth.\n  Some of these NASA technologies, for example, have been applied to the breathing apparatuses worn by firefighters, the fire-resistant suits worn by racecar crews, and, most recently, the deep-sea gear worn by U.S. Navy divers. \n  Partnership\n  Paragon Space Development Corporation, founded in 1993, is located in Tucson, Arizona. This firm is a woman-owned small business, specializing in aerospace engineering and technology development, and is a major supplier of environmental control and life support system and subsystem designs for the aerospace industry. Paragon has proven itself expert in thermal control for spacecraft in orbit and during reentry, as well as for hypervelocity aircraft. \n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n                Paragon Space Development Corporation used its NASA know-how to create diving suits capable of protecting deep-sea divers from hazardous environments.\n    \n  \n  In recent years, Paragon has worked on several different projects that benefit NASA and the space community. Through a NASA-funded Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contract, Paragon utilized its unique thermal analysis and structural design capabilities to develop a new, reduced-weight radiator system for use on the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle, other next-generation spacecraft, and commercial vehicles. \n  Paragon credits the Arizona Department of Commerce and the Governor’s FAST grant award (Federal and State Technology Partnership program) for the seed funds that led to the NASA SBIR award. The FAST grant program is funded by the U.S. Small Business Administration and is focused on capturing Federal grants for competitive small businesses in each state, creating new jobs and new markets that lead to a better and stronger economy by keeping high-technology jobs in America. Paragon used its $5,000 FAST grant award to write its initial proposal to NASA, a partnership that led to continued research grants and development opportunities.\n  Other developments resulting from NASA research include Paragon’s Environmental Control and Life Support Human-rating Facility, which the company designed to test emerging life support system designs for suborbital and orbital spacecraft, and the solid oxide electrolysis (SOE) technology, which is under continued development as a Phase II NASA SBIR. The SOE technology directly breaks down the carbon dioxide given off by the crew of a space vehicle and produces oxygen. This is the only known technology with the potential to supply all the crew’s oxygen needs directly from the crew’s metabolic byproducts, significantly saving spacecraft logistical mass. Another NASA project resulted in the development of the metabolic heat temperature swing absorption, which incorporates the technology innovation of using the metabolic heat generated by a space-suited astronaut to absorb and purge carbon dioxide from the breathing loop.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n      In addition to the obvious dangers inherent in deep-sea diving, divers often encounter hazardous environments, such as waters contaminated by oil and chemical spills, pathogenic microbes, extreme temperatures, and possibly even biological or chemical warfare agents.\n    \n  \n  “[Our] partnership with NASA is growing rapidly and has many facets, from spinoffs that protect and enable the war fighter in extreme environments, to technologies that will be used on the Orion spacecraft, and support astronauts on the Moon and Mars,” explained Taber MacCallum, CEO and chairman of the board for Paragon. “NASA is the premier technology organization, and partnering with NASA is a key part of Paragon’s business plan. In our experience, what you put into the partnership determines what you get out of it. Industry’s partnership with NASA is a central component in maintaining America’s technical preeminence and high- technology jobs.”\n  Similarly, NASA is likely to rely on such commercial space services during the interval between the retirement of the space shuttle and the initial flight of Orion and its Ares launch vehicle.\n  Product Outcome\n  Navy divers are called on to work in extreme and dangerous conditions. The high pressure of deep diving, toxic chemical spills, hot waters of the Persian Gulf, and chemical warfare agents make for some of the most hazardous working environments on Earth. As such, the Navy requested a diving system that will not fail when exposed to chemicals and would create an impermeable protective shell around the diver. Paragon’s extensive experience providing life support in extreme environments assisted in the development of a line of such products to protect Navy divers against hazardous materials; in particular, the successful design of a diving suit that now has the potential for use in commercial diving. \n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n                The specially designed suits provide deep-sea divers with space suit-like protection. \n    \n  \n  In designing the suit, Paragon applied its understanding of air flow in a space suit helmet, use of an umbilical to support an astronaut during a spacewalk, cooling undergarment systems to remove excess body heat, computer codes for thermal and airflow analysis, and materials that have been developed for the aerospace industry that are resistant to extreme chemical and temperature environments.\n  According to MacCallum, the Paragon suit provides “space suit-like” isolation, delivering safe breathing air to the diver. The surface-supplied system collects exhaled air and returns it to the surface to eliminate ingress pathways of hazardous agents through the regulator. The materials, including all soft goods, are impermeable. The development unit has completed unmanned testing, and the human-rated prototype has completed manned testing, having been evaluated by Navy divers at the Navy Experimental Diving Unit facility in Pensacola, Florida.\n  “The contaminated water diving technology that Paragon developed for the Navy came about as a result of our partnership with NASA. We are able to protect the war fighter and enable missions in extreme pressure, temperature, and chemical environments because NASA paved the way with space suit technologies and the operational know-how that allows astronauts to work in the extreme environment of space.”\n  More recently, Paragon provided the Navy with a prototype of its Regulated Surface Exhaust Diving System. The Navy has since requested five units for field testing prior to outfitting all Navy dive suits with the Paragon product. Other products under development at Paragon include individual or collective protection systems designed for use in land vehicles and structures.\n  MacCallum says, “Bringing space technology back to Earth, we provide space suit-like protection for divers working in hazardous environments ranging from chemical and biological warfare agents, to the toxic environment of a shipwreck or chemical spill. Conversely, our technology is now being considered as a way to protect municipal water supplies from being contaminated by divers servicing potable water tanks.”\n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n                      \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                      \n                      "},{"href":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/ps_2.html","text":"Fiber Optic Sensing Monitors Strain and Reduces Costs","image":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/images/ps-4.jpeg","story":"\n                        \n      \n    Public Safety\n      \n  \n  \n    Originating Technology/NASA Contribution\n    In applications where stress on a structure may vary widely and have an unknown impact on integrity, a common engineering strategy has been overbuilding to ensure a sufficiently robust design. While this may be appropriate in applications where weight concerns are not paramount, space applications demand a bare minimum of mass, given astronomical per-pound launch costs. For decades, the preferred solution was the tactic of disassembly and investigation between flights. Knowing there must be a better way, Dr. Mark Froggatt, of Langley Research Center, explored alternate means of monitoring stresses and damage to the space shuttle.\n    While a tear-it-apart-and-have-a-look strategy was effective, it was also a costly and time consuming process that risked further stresses through the very act of disassembly and reassembly. An alternate way of monitoring the condition of parts under the enormous stresses of space flight was needed. Froggatt and his colleagues at Langley built an early-warning device to provide detailed information about even minuscule cracks and deformations by etching a group of tiny lines, or grating, on a fiber optic cable five-thousandths of an inch thick with ultraviolet light. By then gluing the fiber to the side of a part, such as a fuel tank, and shining a laser beam down its length, reflected light indicated which gratings were under stress. Inferring this data from measurements in light rather than in bonded gauges saved additional weight. Various shuttle components now employ the ultrasonic dynamic vector stress sensor (UDVSS), allowing stress detection by measuring light beamed from a built-in mini-laser.\n    By measuring changes in dynamic directional stress occurring in a material or structure, and including phase-locked loop, synchronous amplifier, and contact probe, the UDVSS proved especially useful among manufacturers of aerospace and automotive structures for stress testing and design evaluation. Engineers could ensure safety in airplanes and spaceships with a narrower, not overbuilt, margin of safety. For this development, in 1997, Discover Magazine named Froggatt a winner in the “Eighth Annual Awards for Technological Innovation” from more than 4,000 entries. \n    Partnership\n    Froggatt continued his work in monitoring stresses of fiber optic components, accessories, and networks through optical monitoring at Luna Technologies, a division of Luna Innovations Incorporated, based in Blacksburg, Virginia. At Luna, he headed a team that developed the Optical Backscatter Reflectometer (OBR) with distributed sensing. The OBR is a fiber optic diagnostic tool that locates and troubleshoots splices, breaks, and connectors in fiber assemblies. In addition, it transforms standard telecom-grade fiber into a distributed strain and temperature sensor.\n    In 2002, Luna Innovations Incorporated entered into a licensing agreement with NASA for patent rights to products developed from Froggatt’s earlier work on the UDVSS. Since that initial licensing, Luna has released the Optical Vector Analyzer (OVA), Distributed Sensing System (DSS), and the OBR platforms. \n    Product Outcome\n    \n      \n      \n        \n      \n      \n                    The Optical Vector Analyzer is the first completely integrated solution for measuring critical performance parameters of fiber optic components and modules.\n      \n    \n    Luna now has several lines of sensing and instrumentation products that are sold under the branded name of Luna Technologies. The Luna Technologies brand offers advances in optical test products helping the communications industry to increase productivity and improve component characterization while dramatically reducing the development process and production costs. Fiber optic sensing instruments includes the OVA group, a set of instruments for linear characterization of single-mode optical components, and two different techniques for distributed sensing: the DSS, which uses Fiber Bragg Gratings (FBG), and the OBR, which uses standard telecom-grade optical fiber.\n    First profiled in Spinoff 2002, the OVA is the first instrument on the market that is capable of full and complete all-parameter linear characterization of single-mode optical components. The OVA further evolved into a fast, accurate, and economical suite of tools for loss, dispersion, and polarization measurement of modern optical networking equipment, including FBG, arrayed waveguide gratings, free-space filters, tunable devices, amplifiers, couplers, and specialty fiber. \n    The DSS is a fiber optic sensing tool for taking distributed measurements of temperature and strain. The DSS uses swept-wavelength interferometry to simultaneously interrogate thousands of sensors integrated in a single fiber. These sensors consist of discrete FBG point sensors which can each reflect the same nominal wavelength. As such, the sensors can be fabricated on the draw tower, eliminating the need for individual grating fabrication. DSS applications include structural monitoring for naval, aerospace, and civil structures; temperature profile monitoring in extreme environments; pipeline shift and leak detection; and electrical power line sag and temperature monitoring.\n    The OBR offers unprecedented diagnostic capabilities and is a true high-resolution optical time domain reflectometer designed specifically for qualifying fiber components, modules, and cable assemblies for telecommunications, avionics/military-aerospace, and fiber-sensing applications. Through distributed sensing, the OBR can transform standard telecom-grade fiber into a high-spatial-resolution strain and temperature sensor. Using swept wavelength interferometry (SWI) to measure the Rayleigh backscatter as a function of length in optical fiber with high-spatial resolution, the OBR measures shifts and scales them to give a distributed temperature or strain measurement. The SWI approach enables robust and practical distributed temperature and strain measurements in standard fiber with millimeter-scale spatial resolution over hundreds of meters of fiber with strain and temperature resolution as fine as 1 µstrain and 0.1 °C.\n    As with the other fiber optic monitoring tools, OBR provides isolation of faults and problems well before final testing, saving hours in rework and expenses in yield loss.\n    These abilities netted the OBR some prestigious awards:\n    \n      \n        2005 Lightwave “Attendees’ Choice Award” in the Test Equipment category for the second consecutive year.          \n      \n      \n        2005 Frost & Sullivan “Optical Product of the Year Award,” as the industry’s most sensitive frequency domain reflectometer.          \n      \n      \n        2007 “R&D 100” award from the editors of R&D Magazine as one of the 100 most technologically significant new products introduced into the marketplace in the last year. Past “R&D 100” awards acknowledgements have included the automated teller machine (ATM), the fax machine, the NicoDerm antismoking patch, and high-definition television (HDTV). \n      \n    \n    “The ‘R&D 100’ award provides a mark of excellence known to industry, government, and academia as proof that a product is one of the most innovative of the year across a broad range of technologies,” said Brian Soller, president of the Products Division at Luna. “This is the first year Luna has submitted an award nomination to the R&D 100, and we are honored to have our test and measurement instrument selected as part of this truly elite group.”\n    Released in March 2007, the OBR 4400 is an upgraded version of the OBR instrument, with enhanced capabilities in a more compact design. Range has been increased to 2 kilometers, still with millimeters of resolution, and users can monitor the effects from component-level heating in optical amplifiers to strain and load redistribution in aircraft harnesses. Other applications include temperature monitoring inside telecommunications cabinets and enclosures, and a feature that allows users to identify the location in fiber assemblies simply by touching the fiber. With a small, easily transportable platform, the OBR 4400 provides the user with precision reflectometry and unprecedented optical-module inspection and diagnostic capabilities.

While the space shuttle and capsule vehicles necessarily receive a great deal of thermal barrier and insulation protection, at least as much attention is also paid to astronaut clothing and personal gear. NASA has spent a great deal of effort developing and refining fire-resistant materials for use in vehicles, flight suits, and other applications demanding extreme thermal tolerances, and kept a close eye on the cutting edge of high-temperature stable polymers for its entire 50-year history.\n  In the late 1950s, Dr. Carl Marvel first synthesized Polybenzimidazole (PBI) while studying the creation of high-temperature stable polymers for the U.S. Air Force. In 1961, PBI was further developed by Marvel and Dr. Herward Vogel, correctly anticipating that the polymers would have exceptional thermal and oxidative stability. In 1963, NASA and the Air Force Materials Laboratory sponsored considerable work with PBI for aerospace and defense applications as a non-flammable and thermally stable textile fiber. \n  On January 27, 1967, the severity and immediacy of the danger of fire faced by astronauts was made terribly clear when a flash fire occurred in command module 012 during a launch pad test of the Apollo/Saturn space vehicle being prepared for the first piloted flight, the AS-204 mission (also known as Apollo 1). Three astronauts, Lieutenant Colonel Virgil I. Grissom, a veteran of Mercury and Gemini missions; Lieutenant Colonel Edward H. White II, the astronaut who had performed the first U.S. extravehicular activity during the Gemini program; and Lieutenant Commander Roger B. Chaffee, an astronaut preparing for his first space flight, died in this tragic accident. \n  A final report on the tragedy, completed in April 1967, made specific recommendations for major design and engineering modifications, including severely restricting and controlling the amount and location of combustible materials in the command module and the astronaut flight suits. NASA intensified its focus on advanced fire-resistant materials, and given the Agency’s existing familiarity with the fabric and its inventor, one of the first alternatives considered was PBI. \n  Partnership\n  NASA contracted with Celanese Corporation, of New York, to develop a line of PBI textiles for use in space suits and vehicles. Celanese engineers developed heat- and flame-resistant PBI fabric based on the fiber for high-temperature applications. The fibers formed from the PBI polymer exhibited a number of highly desirable characteristics, such as inflammability, no melting point, and retention of both strength and flexibility after exposure to flame. The stiff fibers also maintained their integrity when exposed to high heat and were mildew, abrasion, and chemical resistant.\n  Throughout the 1970s and into the 1980s, PBI was instrumental to space flight, seeing application on Apollo, Skylab, and numerous space shuttle missions. Applications ran the gamut from the intended applications in astronaut flight suits and clothing, to webbing, tethers, and other gear that demanded durability and extreme thermal tolerance. \n  Product Outcome\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n                Andre Baur, a firefighter instructor in Switzerland, runs out of a training fire that has gotten out of hand. Like many other “Golden Knights” around the world, Andre escaped with only minor injuries.\n    \n  \n  In 1978, PBI was introduced to fire service in the United States, and Project FIRES (Firefighters Integrated Response Equipment System) lauded a recently developed outer shell material for turnout gear, PBI Gold. In 1983, PBI fibers were made commercially available and a dedicated production plant opened in Rock Hill, South Carolina, to meet demand. In 1986, NASA Spinoff chronicled this first phase of PBI’s history, and Marvel was awarded the “National Medal of Science” by President Ronald Reagan. \n  Since 1986, PBI has undergone a steady evolution into countless military and civilian applications and established a distinct profile and reputation in the fire retardant materials industry. In 2005, Celanese Corporation sold the PBI fiber and polymer business to PBI Performance Products Inc., of Charlotte, North Carolina, which is under the ownership of the InterTech Group, of North Charleston, South Carolina. \n  Produced by a dedicated manufacturer that takes great pride in the history and future of the product, the fabrics incorporating PBI have become prominent players in such diverse applications as firefighting and emergency response, motor sports, military, industry, and (still) aerospace. PBI Performance Products now offers two distinct lines: PBI, the original heat and flame resistant fiber; and Celazole, a family of high-temperature PBI polymers available in true polymer form.\n  \n    \n      PBI fabric withstands the dangers associated with firefighting, arc flash, and flash fire. In 1992, lightweight PBI fabrics were adapted for flame-resistant work wear for electric utility and petrochemical applications, and are now providing flame protection for U.S. Army troops in Afghanistan and Iraq. Short-cut PBI fibers were introduced for use in automotive braking systems and PBI staple fibers are employed as fire blocking layers in aircraft seats.        \n    \n    \n      PBI Gold blends 40 percent thermal-resistant PBI fibers with 60 percent high-strength aramid, resulting in a fabric which does not shrink, become brittle, or break open under extreme heat and flame exposure. PBI Gold provides firefighters and industrial workers with superior protection and meets or exceeds every National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) and EN 469 (rating standard for protective clothing for firefighters) requirement. In 1994, the New York City Fire Department specified the use of PBI Gold fabric engineered in black for their turnout gear. Over the last 10 years, PBI Gold has grown internationally, with major industrial, military, and municipal fire brigades specifying the product across Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Australia, and the South Pacific.        \n    \n    \n      PBI Matrix employs a “power grid,” a durable matrix of high-strength aramid filaments woven into the PBI Gold fabric to enhance and reinforce its resistance to wear and tear while retaining its superior flame and heat protection. In 2003, PBI Matrix was commercialized and introduced in the United States as the next-generation PBI for firefighter turnout gear. In 2008, Matrix will be introduced in Europe.        \n    \n    \n      PBI TriGuard fabric is a three-fiber blend of PBI, Lenzing FR, and MicroTwaron designed for flame protection, comfort, and durability. This advanced fabric meets or exceeds all U.S. Department of Labor Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and NFPA standards and is certified for wildlands, special operations, and motorsports applications, as well as the petrochemical, gas utility, and electric utility industries. PBI TriGuard and PBI Gold knits are now in use at several major motorsport racetracks around the country.        \n    \n    \n      Celazole T-Series is a form-, shape-, and an injection-moldable blend of PBI and PEEK (polyetheretherketone) polymers.      \n    \n    \n      Celazole U-Series utilizes PBI’s high-heat dimensional stability, strength, and chemical resistance to allow it to be formed into parts and used in the tools that produce flat panel displays and in the plasma etch chambers used to make semiconductor wafers.        \n    \n  \n  New applications for PBI are continuing to come to light in new fields that demand material stability at high temperatures. PBI is now being developed into high-temperature separation membranes that increase efficiency in ethanol production and separate carbon dioxide from natural gas for carbon dioxide sequestration, and will see application in hydrogen fuel cells. PBI in short-cut form has also been used as a safe and effective replacement for asbestos. Fittingly, PBI may also return to space as part of NASA’s Constellation Program, as the polymer once applied for space suits in the Apollo and Skylab missions is under consideration for use as insulation material in the rocket motors for NASA’s next generation of spacecraft, the Ares I and Ares V rockets.\n  PBI TriGuard™ is a trademark, and PBI Gold®, PBI Matrix®, and Celazole® are registered trademarks of PBI Performance Products Inc.\n  Lenzing FR® is a registered trademark of Lenzing Fibers GmbH.\n  MicroTwaron™ is a trademark of Akzo N.V. \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n                      \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                      \n                      "},{"href":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/ps_4.html","text":"Advanced X-Ray Sources Ensure Safe Environments","image":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/images/ps-7.jpeg","story":"\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n  Public Safety\n  \n\n\n  Originating Technology/NASA Contribution\n  Successfully sustaining life in space requires closely monitoring the environment to ensure the health of the crew. Astronauts can be more sensitive to air pollutants because of the closed environment, and pollutants are magnified in space exploration because the astronauts’ exposure is continuous. Sources of physical, chemical, and microbiological contaminants include humans and other organisms, food, cabin surface materials, and experiment devices. \n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n                The electron beam source can be scaled to fit any duct size and the flanges adapted to mate with existing systems. Reactions with the electron beam in the duct section destroy or neutralize contaminants entering via the airstream.\n    \n  \n  One hazard is the off-gassing of vapors from plastics and other inorganic materials aboard the vehicle, vividly illustrated by Skylab—in 1973, NASA scientists identified 107 volatile organic compounds in the air inside the Skylab space station. All synthetic materials exude low-level gasses, known as off-gassing; when these chemicals are trapped in a closed environment, as was the case with the Skylab, the inhabitants may become ill. To avoid this, air sampling systems on the International Space Station (ISS) periodically check the air for potential hazards. Advanced, high-efficiency particulate air filters and periodic filter cleanings have been successful in keeping harmful vapors out of the air. Other significant contaminants that pose hazards to the crew are microbial growth, both bacterial and fungal; air, water, and surface sampling by the crew in conjunction with periodic cleaning keep the microbial levels on the ISS in check. \n  To monitor microbial levels, crew members use devices called grab sample containers, dual absorbent tubes, and swabs to collect station air, water, and surface samples and send them to Earth for detailed analysis and identification every 6 months. This data provides controllers on Earth detailed information about the type of microbial contaminants on board the ISS. The controllers can then give additional direction to the crew on sanitation if increased microbial growth is identified.\n  Missions to the Moon and Mars will increase the length of time that astronauts live and work in closed environments. To complete future long-duration missions, the crews must remain healthy in these\n    closed environments; hence, future spacecraft must provide even more advanced sensors to monitor environmental health and accurately determine and control the physical, chemical, and biological environment of the crew living areas and their environmental control systems.\n  Partnership\n  Ames Research Center awarded inXitu Inc. (formerly Microwave Power Technology), of Mountain View, California, a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contract to develop a new design of electron optics for forming and focusing electron beams that is applicable to a broad class of vacuum electron devices. \n  This project resulted in a compact and rugged X-ray tube with a carbon nanotube (CNT) cold cathode with a circular electron beam that is focused to a diameter of less than 80 microns. The performance, durability, and operating life of CNT cathodes was enhanced by inXitu working in cooperation with Ames; Oxford Instruments, of Scotts Valley, California; and Xintek Inc., of Research Triangle Park, North Carolina; among others. inXitu constructed an automated system for screening up to 10 CNT cathodes at once. Performance data from these tests helped CNT cathode researchers and developers improve tolerance to device processing, uniformity, and stability of performance within a given lot, enhancing performance of electron beam sources and ionizers in addition to other classes of X-ray tubes. This technology provides:\n  \n    \n      Inherently rugged and more efficient X-ray sources for material analysis\n        \n    \n    \n      A miniature and rugged X-ray source for smaller rovers on future missions \n        \n    \n    \n      Compact electron beam sources to reduce undesirable emissions from small, widely distributed pollution sources and remediation of polluted sites\n        \n    \n    \n      Large area emitters for new X-ray sources in future baggage scanning systems\n    \n  \n  Researchers derived a mathematical distribution function for the beam with a purpose-built electron beam analyzer, which characterized the unique behavior of electron beams emitted from CNT cathodes. A boundary element computer incorporated the distribution function code to design the electron optics, with an electrostatically focused electron gun and magnetic lens to focus the electron. The final X-ray tube consists of rugged metal ceramic construction welded into a 2-inch-diameter package along with a 40 kV power supply. This design forms a hermetic package that can withstand severe environmental stresses encountered during launch, landing, and operation in space.\n  NASA will apply this technology in versatile X-ray instruments capable of operating in both a fluorescence or diffraction mode for in situ analysis of rocks and soils of the solid bodies in the solar system to determine their atomic constituents and mineralogy. Other applications of this technology include purifying air in space and Moon base stations, eliminating toxic products and biological toxins in aircraft, enhancing chemical reactions in space-based manufacturing, and sterilization of material to be returned to Earth or taken to space from Earth. inXitu was awarded a Phase III SBIR contract in 2006 to continue this work. \n  Product Outcome\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n                The electron beam analyzer was designed to characterize the emission properties of carbon nanotube cathodes.\n    \n  \n  Oxford’s X-ray Technology Group provides laboratory space and production support for continuing development and commercialization of advanced CNT-based vacuum sources. The company produced Eclipse 1 and Eclipse 2 X-ray sources from inXitu’s prototype that was used in hand-held and portable fluorescence spectrometers for in situ analysis of materials and surfaces. The Eclipse 2 X-ray tube was applied in equipment for monitoring paper coating and other high-speed processes. \n  Next-generation baggage and cargo screening systems employ CNT cold cathode X-ray sources, promising increased throughput, reduced false alarm rates, reduced power consumption, reduced heat load, reduced size and weight, and improved ruggedness and responsiveness over existing thermionic X-ray sources. Additional commercial applications include air purification; odor elimination; non-burning destruction of evaporated hydrocarbons from fuel tanks and painting operations; soil and groundwater remediation; flue gas cleaning; and chemical reaction enhancements, such as increasing fuel efficiency and reducing ink drying speed, as well as surface sterilization.\n    \n    \n    \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n      \n\n\n  \n\n"},{"href":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/ch.html","text":" Consumer, Home, and Recreation","image":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/images/Spinoff_-Nav.gif","story":"\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n  NASA research improves our quality of life.

Woodard and Bryant D. Taylor, of ATK Space, developed a novel wireless fluid-level measurement system. \n  Current fluid-level measurement methods, which see widespread application, have significant drawbacks, including limited applicability of any one fluid-level sensor design; necessity for each sensor to be supplied power via a direct electrical connection and have a physical connection to extract a measurement; and need for a data channel and signal conditioning electronics dedicated to each sensor. Use of typical wired systems results in other shortcomings, such as logistics for adding or replacing sensors, weight, and the potential for electrical arcing and wire degradations. \n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n              In addition to giving boat operators a highly accurate reading of fuel levels, this sensor detects water in the bottom of the tank, whether it is mixed with ethanol, gasoline, diesel, or two-stroke oil.\n    \n  \n  The wireless fluid-level measurement system that Woodard and Taylor developed, however, uses sensors that are simple: passive inductor-capacitor circuits. The system is laid out in seven U.S. and international patents and patents-pending, collectively resulting in an inexpensive and safe wireless fuel measurement system that can be used to measure the volume of any fluid at any orientation. A key safety feature unique to the system is that it allows the sensors to be completely encapsulated so that the fuel level can be measured with neither the fuel nor fuel vapors coming in contact with any electrical components of the system, thus eliminating the potential for combustible fuel vapors being ignited by arcing from damaged electrical components. \n  Woodard explains, “This technology eliminates many of the causes of the TWA Flight 800 and Swissair Flight 111 accidents. These accidents resulted in the loss of 459 lives. In both cases, damage to a direct electrical line from the aircraft power system to a fuel probe inside a fuel tank containing combustible fuel vapors was a critical link in a chain of events that led to these tragedies.” \n  The sensor is also not subject to the mechanical failure possible when float and lever-arm systems are used—system sensors are powered by oscillating magnetic fields; once electrically excited, each sensor produces its own magnetic field response, the frequency of which corresponds to the amount of fluid within the sensor’s electric field. The system can be used to measure any fluid in any container, including those on aircraft, cars, boats, trains, trucks, or even the space shuttle and satellites. In addition to the safety features, the system is able to automatically recalibrate for new fuels, a feature that is becoming more attractive as the number of flex-fuel vehicles increases. \n  One especially key advantage of this technology is that it can be used with any system requiring fluid-level measurement, regardless of the fluid being measured. The sensor design can be modified for measuring the level of any fluid or non-gaseous fluid substance that can be stored in a nonconductive reservoir. The inventors demonstrated this by measuring levels of ammonia, liquid nitrogen, salt water, tap water, transmission fluid, bleach, sugar water, and hydrochloric acid—all elements that would easily destroy most electronics. The system’s ability to take accurate measurements of the level of non-liquids has been tested with powdered sugar and ground corn. Perhaps most importantly, it has been used to measure the levels of a variety of petroleum products, which led to its first commercial application. \n  Partnership\n  The NASA technology was of interest to Tidewater Sensors LLC, of Newport News, Virginia, because of its many advantages over conventional fuel management systems, including its ability to provide an accurate measurement of volume while the boat is experiencing any rocking motion due to waves or people moving about on the boat. Like a conventional float gauge, it is quick and easy to install, but unlike the float gauge, this device has no moving parts, is sealed from the elements, and allows the boat owner to use any size or shape tank and still get an accurate reading. The system also introduces no electronics into the tank and has no connections at the sensor that need grounding. These advantages led the company to license the novel fluid-level measurement system from NASA for marine applications.\n  Product Outcome\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n              Prototypes of the devices were used on the Hampton, Virginia, fire and police department boats.\n    \n  \n  The Tidewater Sensors commercial version of the NASA measurement system is available under the name TS1500. The non-moving probe contains both the antenna and the sensor as a single unit that is easily interfaced to any of the standard fuel display gauges used. The TS1500 is a simple, safe, easy-to-operate tool that prevents expensive motor damage and helps prevent boaters from getting stranded due to motor failure. \n  If the TS1500 detects water, it alerts the operator with both an audible and visual alarm: the machine beeps and the fuel gauge fluctuates rapidly between empty and full. Unlike other water sensors, which require that the water be mixed with the fuel and the boat be run for a few minutes before they will operate, this sensor will alert the operator before he leaves the dock. This means that boat operators can avoid an engine-stopping combination of water and fuel in open waters. The TS1500 sounds the alarm as soon as the engine is turned on, if water is present, or as soon as the sensor touches the water.\n  The product boasts several other advantages over traditional float systems or capacitor sensors: it is highly accurate; senses water in gas, oil, or diesel; and uses a specially formulated rubber gasket capable of withstanding ethanol, as opposed to typical methods that provide rough measurements of fluid in the tank and use cork or butyl rubber stoppers that corrode when exposed to ethanol, leading to leaks. The TS1500 also provides linear measurements of tank capacity, as opposed to the swinging arm of a non-linear measurement, which leaves the needle indicating full for a longer period of time than may be accurate and then moves quickly toward the “E.”\n  Tidewater Sensors has already built and field tested prototype sensors. Testing took place on boats ranging from 20 to 32 feet long, operating on coastal waters between Delaware and North Carolina. For some high-profile testing, the sensors were installed on the Hampton City (home to Langley) Fire Division’s 30-foot boat, which patrols all 64 miles of the Hampton area shoreline, and the Hampton City Police boat. Sensors were also installed on a Donzi ZF powerboat owned by John Isley of the nationally syndicated morning radio show, John Boy and Billy’s “The Big Show.” With this high-profile testing, and boasting so many clear benefits, the NASA technology is sure to find wide commercial acceptance.\n\n  \n  \n\n                      \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                      \n                      "},{"href":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/ch_2.html","text":"Mars Cameras Make Panoramic Photography a Snap","image":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/images/ch-3.jpeg","story":"\n                      \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                      \n                                              \n                        Consumer, Home, and Recreation\n                          \n                      \n          \n                        Originating Technology/NASA Contribution \n                        \n                          \n                          \n                            \n                          \n                          \n                                                          The Gigapan robotic platform now enables photographers on Earth to capture and create super-sized digital panoramas.\n                          \n                        \n                        If you wish to explore a Martian landscape without leaving your armchair, a few simple clicks around the NASA Web site will lead you to panoramic photographs taken from the Mars Exploration Rovers, Spirit and Opportunity. Many of the technologies that enable this spectacular Mars photography have also inspired advancements in photography here on Earth, including the panoramic camera (Pancam) and its housing assembly, designed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Cornell University for the Mars missions. Mounted atop each rover, the Pancam mast assembly (PMA) can tilt a full 180 degrees and swivel 360 degrees, allowing for a complete, highly detailed view of the Martian landscape. \n                        The rover Pancams take small, 1 megapixel (1 million pixel) digital photographs, which are stitched together into large panoramas that sometimes measure 4 by 24 megapixels. The Pancam software performs some image correction and stitching after the photographs are transmitted back to Earth. Different lens filters and a spectrometer also assist scientists in their analyses of infrared radiation from the objects in the photographs. These photographs from Mars spurred developers to begin thinking in terms of larger and higher quality images: super-sized digital pictures, or gigapixels, which are images composed of 1 billion or more pixels.\n                        Gigapixel images are more than 200 times the size captured by today’s standard 4 megapixel digital camera. Although originally created for the Mars missions, the detail provided by these large photographs allows for many purposes, not all of which are limited to extraterrestrial photography. \n                        Partnership\n                        The technology behind the Mars rover PMAs inspired Randy Sargent at Ames Research Center and Illah Nourbakhsh at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) to look at ways consumers might be able to use similar technology for more “down-to-Earth” photography and virtual exploration. \n                        In 2005, Sargent and Nourbakhsh created the Global Connection Project, a collaboration of scientists from CMU, Google Inc., and the National Geographic Society, whose vision is to encourage better understanding of the Earth’s cultures through images. This vision inspired the development of their Gigapan products. \n                        After seeing what the Pancams and PMAs could do, Sargent created a prototype for a consumer-version of a robotic camera platform. He worked with Rich LeGrand of Charmed Labs LLC, in Austin, Texas, to design and manufacture the Gigapan robotic platform for standard digital cameras. \n                        Product Outcome\n                        The Gigapan robotic platform is, in essence, an intelligent tripod that enables an amateur photographer to set up detailed shots with ease. A user sets the upper-left and lower-right corners of the panorama, and the Gigapan simply will capture as many images as the user or scene requires. With this level of automation, a 500-picture panorama is no more complicated than a 4-picture panorama; only the camera’s memory limits the size of the panorama. \n                        The Global Connection Project also created two other Gigapan products: a Gigapan Web site and panorama stitching software born from the Ames Vision Workbench, an image processing and computer vision library developed by the Autonomous Systems and Robotics Area in the Intelligent Systems Division. \n                        \n                          \n                          \n                            \n                          \n                          \n                                                          Gigapan allows a photographer to capture extremely high-resolution panoramas, which a user can explore in depth. In this wide view of Boudhanath Stupa in Kathmandu, Nepal, it is possible to zoom all the way into the smallest, barely visible points in the picture, such as the monk standing on the roof of the temple or the sign above the Tibet Kitchen Restaurant and Bar. \n                            Gigapan panoramic image courtesy of Jessee Mayfield.  \n                          \n                        \n                        The robotic platform works with the stitching software by precisely manipulating and aligning each shot ahead of time. The Gigapan software complements the robotic platform by arranging the parts of the panorama (potentially hundreds of individual photographs) into a grid where they are stitched together into a single, very large Gigapan image.\n                        The Global Connection Project won a 2006 “Economic Development Award” from the Tech Museum Awards for its work in creating photographic overlays for Google Earth of areas affected by natural disasters. Government workers and concerned citizens used the images on Google Earth to see which areas needed help in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, Hurricane Rita, and the 2005 earthquake in Kashmir.\n                        On the Gigapan Web site, a user can display a wide bird’s eye panorama and can then zoom in with impressive bug’s eye high-quality detail. On first impression, a panoramic photograph on Gigapan’s site might seem to be simply a wide-angle cityscape of a temple in Kathmandu. With each successive click, however, the user can zoom deeper and deeper into the photo, revealing more and more clear details: a monk hanging prayer flags on the roof of the temple and the Tibet Kitchen Restaurant and Bar a few blocks behind the temple, with a sign extolling passersby to taste their gourmet food. \n                        As part of a continuing effort to connect people and cultures, the Global Connection Project encourages all users to upload their own panoramas from around the world on the Gigapan site. Users can explore such varied landscapes as a temple in Nepal, the Burning Man festival in the Nevada desert, a market in Guatemala, or the Boston skyline from the Charles River. Because of the much greater number of pixels, the resolution is unprecedented; the Gigapan software and robotic platforms can theoretically produce prints on 40-foot-wide paper without any loss in quality.\n                        Whether or not photographers use the Gigapan mounts and software, anyone can upload their panoramas to the Gigapan Web site. Many users of Gigapan have uploaded standard panorama photographs, as well (although the site suggests photographs be at least 50 megabytes). This is just fine with the Gigapan and the Global Connection Project coordinators, whose aim is simply to encourage exploration and understanding of the various cultures in our world.\n                         The Fine Family Foundation is sponsoring work with the Global Connection Project to enable botanists, geologists, archeologists, and other scientists around the world to document different aspects of the Earth’s cultures and ecosystems using Gigapan technology. Scientists are using Gigapan to document life in the upper redwood forest canopy in California, volcanoes in Hawaii, and glaciers in Norway. \n                        There are also educational uses for the Gigapan: The Pennsylvania Board of Tourism uses Gigapan for Web site visitors wanting to explore Civil War sites virtually. Also, in collaboration with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the Global Connection Project has distributed Gigapan to students in Pittsburgh, South Africa, and the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, encouraging them to photograph their local culture and share those panoramas with the world. “The hope is that students will be able to have deeper connections to other cultures,” said Sargent.\n                        A time-lapse Gigapan robotic mount is now in development, and a professional unit for larger SLR-style cameras may be released before the end of 2008.\n                        Gigapan™ is a trademark of Carnegie Mellon University.\n                      \n                       \n                       \n                       \n                       \n                      \n                      \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                      \n"},{"href":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/ch_3.html","text":"Experiments Advance Gardening at Home and in Space","image":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/images/ch-5.jpeg","story":"\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n  Consumer, Home, and Recreation\n  \n\n\n  Originating Technology/NASA Contribution\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n                Tomato plants growing in the Plant Development Habitat (PDHab) at BioServe Space Technologies. For a recent experiment on the International Space Station, the PDHab was loaded into a Commercial Generic BioProcessing Apparatus, a temperature-controlled microgravity research platform that has hosted a variety of experiments on numerous space shuttle, Mir, and ISS missions. \n    \n  \n  Aeroponics, the process of growing plants suspended in air without soil or media, provides clean, efficient, and rapid food production. Crops can be planted and harvested year-round without interruption, and without contamination from soil, pesticides, and residue. Aeroponic systems also reduce water usage by 98 percent, fertilizer usage by 60 percent, and eliminate pesticide usage altogether. Plants grown in aeroponic systems have been shown to absorb more minerals and vitamins, making the plants healthier and potentially more nutritious. \n  The suspended system also has other advantages. Since the growing environment can be kept clean and sterile, the chances of spreading plant diseases and infections commonly found in soil and other growing media are greatly reduced. Also, seedlings do not stretch or wilt while their roots are forming, and once the roots are developed, the plants can be easily moved into any type of growing media without the risk of transplant shock. Lastly, plants tend to grow faster in a regulated aeroponic environment, and the subsequent ease of transplant to a natural medium means a higher annual crop yield. For example, tomatoes are traditionally started in pots and transplanted to the ground at least 28 days later; growers using an aeroponic system can transplant them just 10 days after starting the plants in the growing chamber. This accelerated cycle produces six tomato crops per year, rather than the traditional one to two crop cycles. \n  These benefits, along with the great reduction in weight by eliminating soil and much of the water required for plant growth, illustrate why this technique has found such enthusiastic support from NASA. Successful long-term missions into deep space will require crews to grow some of their own food during flight. Aeroponic crops are also a potential source of fresh oxygen and clean drinking water, and every ounce of food produced and water conserved aboard a spacecraft reduces payload weight, decreasing launch costs and freeing room for other cargo. \n  Partnership\n  In 1997, NASA teamed with AgriHouse Inc., of Berthoud, Colorado, to develop an aeroponic experiment for use on the Mir space station. Richard Stoner II, founder and president of AgriHouse, had worked with aeroponics since the late 1980s, and developed and patented a method for aeroponic crop production. AgriHouse utilized the research direction of BioServe Space Technologies, a nonprofit, NASA-sponsored Research Partnership Center located at the University of Colorado in Boulder, to assist its efforts in developing its aeroponic technology for space flight (Spinoff 2006). BioServe has extensive experience in space flight, having flown payload experiments on 27 shuttle missions, 2 Mir missions (one being the above-mentioned), and several missions on the International Space Station (ISS). \n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n                The AeroGrow Seed Pod houses and protects seeds before germination and provides a platform on which to grow \n    after germination.\n    \n  \n  To continue NASA’s development of aeroponic technologies and offer a unique educational experience to students around the world, an experiment designed and built by BioServe recently flew to the ISS aboard the NASA Space Shuttle Endeavour on STS-118, in August 2007. This experiment, designed by Heike Winter-Sederroff, assistant professor of Plant Gravitational Genomics at North Carolina State University, will advance the science of growing food during long-term space expeditions and further the development of heartier varieties of tomato plants for farmers and gardeners on Earth. The experiment is also part of an educational effort involving as many as 15,000 K-12 students and teachers around the world, who will compare the growth and development of tomato plants in space with similar experiments being conducted in their own classrooms. \n  Essential to the success of this research was ensuring the seeds were protected on the way to the ISS, and at the same time, unable to germinate before the start of the experiment. BioServe identified an ideal medium for this transport while meeting with representatives from AeroGrow International Inc., also of Boulder, Colorado. AeroGrow’s proprietary Seed Pod technology, developed for use in its AeroGarden kitchen gardening appliance, was admirably suited to the task in that it encased the seeds in a plastic framework, and thereby protected them during transit and ensured germination would not take place until proscribed by the experiment.\n  “AeroGrow is proud that the technologies that make our garden so simple and easy to use are being tested for growing fresh food in space as well,” said Michael Bissonnette, founder and chairman of AeroGrow. “We’re thrilled to contribute to the education of so many students, and are looking forward to introducing the AeroGarden in classrooms and educational environments around the world.” \n  Product Outcome\n  The use of AeroGrow Seed Pods on the ISS can be seen as the fitting fruition of an idea that sprouted several years ago. Bissonnette and colleague John Thompson were inspired by NASA experiments using aeroponic gardening to grow lettuce. The experiments reinforced that plants grown aeroponically did so significantly faster than those grown by any other method. Bissonnette and his team started working to capture this technology in a clean, simple, quick, and dependable appliance that would work in homes. \n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n                The AeroGarden has proven a very popular way to bring the fun and reward of growing herbs, vegetables, and \n    flowers indoors.\n    \n  \n  More than up to the task, AeroGrow’s scientific board boasts a deep background in horticulture and aeroponics, and a depth of understanding that has helped the AeroGarden achieve such great success. For instance, Dr. Henry A. Robitaille holds undergraduate, master’s, and doctorate degrees in horticulture from the University of Maryland and Michigan State University. Notably, he helped design and implement hydroponic growing systems in The Land Pavilion at Epcot Center in the Walt Disney World Resort, collaborating extensively with the NASA Controlled Ecological Life Support System research team at Kennedy Space Center.\n  Adapting a process as complicated as aeroponics to an automatic home appliance proved a considerable challenge and yielded impressive results. The more than 15 resulting patent applications include specialized lighting systems, nutrient tablets that nourish the plants and ensure standard pH levels regardless of municipal water supply, and the Plug & Grow Seed Pods that recently found their way to the ISS. The appeal of the AeroGarden has been proven in recent years, as the company has shipped over 350,000 gardens. \n  To this success, Bissonnette reflected, “We have succeeded in every retail channel of distribution we’ve rolled into, including independent culinary stores, national department store chains, independent lawn and garden and hardware chains, and have just concluded successful tests with multiple big-box retailers.” Though still largely rooted in Internet and infomercial sales, AeroGardens are now found in more than 4,300 storefronts. AeroGrow has set its sights on international markets while continuing to refine and enlarge its product line. Now applied in homes and schools nationwide, and with its Seed Pods seeing application on the ISS, the fruits of NASA’s work in past decades are made available in the simplicity of a kitchen countertop gardening appliance.\n  AeroGarden™, Seed Pod™, and Plug & Grow™ are trademarks of AeroGrow International Inc.\n    \n    \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n                      \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                      \n                      "},{"href":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/ch_4.html","text":"Space Age Swimsuit Reduces Drag, Breaks Records","image":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/images/ch-8.jpeg","story":"\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n  Consumer, Home, and Recreation\n  \n\n\n  Originating Technology/NASA Contribution\n  \n    \n    \n      \n      NASA helped Speedo reduce viscous drag in the new LZR Racer by performing surface drag testing and applying expertise in the area of fluid dynamics.\n    \n  \n  A space shuttle and a competitive swimmer have a lot more in common than people might realize: Among other forces, both have to contend with the slowing influence of drag. NASA’s Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate focuses primarily on improving flight efficiency and generally on fluid dynamics, especially the forces of pressure and viscous drag, which are the same for bodies moving through air as for bodies moving through water. Viscous drag is the force of friction that slows down a moving object through a substance, like air or water.\n  NASA uses wind tunnels for fluid dynamics research, studying the forces of friction in gasses and liquids. Pressure forces, according to Langley Research Center’s Stephen Wilkinson, “dictate the optimal shape and performance of an airplane or other aero/hydro-dynamic body.” In both high-speed flight and swimming, says Wilkinson, a thin boundary layer of reduced velocity fluid surrounds the moving body; this layer is about 2 centimeters thick for a swimmer. \n  Partnership\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n                The LZR Racer provides extra compression in key areas to help a swimmer use less energy to swim more quickly.\n    \n  \n  In spite of some initial skepticism, Los Angeles-based SpeedoUSA asked NASA to help design a swimsuit with reduced drag, shortly after the 2004 Olympics. According to Stuart Isaac, senior vice president of Team Sales and Sports Marketing, “People would look at us and say ‘this isn’t rocket science’ and we began to think, ‘well, actually, maybe it is.’” While most people would not associate space travel with swimwear, rocket science is exactly what SpeedoUSA decided to try. The manufacturer sought a partnership with NASA because of the Agency’s expertise in the field of fluid dynamics and in the area of combating drag. \n  A 2004 computational fluid dynamics study conducted by Speedo’s Aqualab research and development unit determined that the viscous drag on a swimmer is about 25 percent of the total retarding force. In competitive swimming, where every hundredth of a second counts, the best possible reduction in drag is crucially important. Researchers began flat plate testing of fabrics, using a small wind tunnel developed for earlier research on low-speed viscous drag reduction, and Wilkinson collaborated over the next few years with Speedo’s Aqualab to design what Speedo now considers the most efficient swimsuit yet: the LZR Racer. Surface drag testing was performed with the help of Langley, and additional water flume testing and computational fluid dynamics were performed with guidance from the University of Otago (New Zealand) and ANSYS Inc., a computer-aided engineering firm. \n  “Speedo had the materials in mind [for the LZR Racer],” explains Isaac, “but we did not know how they would perform in surface friction drag testing, which is where we enlisted the help of NASA.” The manufacturer says the fabric, which Speedo calls LZR Pulse, is not only efficient at reducing drag, but it also repels water and is extremely lightweight. Speedo tested about 100 materials and material coatings before settling on LZR Pulse. \n  NASA and Speedo performed tests on traditionally sewn seams, ultrasonically welded seams, and the fabric alone, which gave Speedo a baseline for reducing drag caused by seams and helped them identify problem areas. NASA wind tunnel results helped Speedo “create a bonding system that eliminates seams and reduces drag,” according to Isaac. The Speedo LZR Racer is the first fully bonded, full-body swimsuit with ultrasonically welded seams. Instead of sewing overlapping pieces of fabric together, Speedo actually fused the edges ultrasonically, reducing drag by 6 percent. “The ultrasonically welded seams have just slightly more drag than the fabric alone,” Isaac explains. NASA results also showed that a low-profile zipper ultrasonically bonded (not sewn) into the fabric and hidden inside the suit generated 8 percent less drag in wind tunnel tests than a standard zipper. Low-profile seams and zippers were a crucial component in the LZR Racer because the suit consists of multiple connecting fabric pieces—instead of just a few sewn pieces such as found in traditional suits—that provide extra compression for maximum efficiency. \n  Product Outcome\n  \n    \n    \n      \n      \n        The LZR Racer reduces skin friction drag by covering more skin than traditional swimsuits. Multiple pieces of the water-resistant and extremely lightweight LZR Pulse fabric connect at ultrasonically welded seams and incorporate extremely low-profile zippers to keep viscous drag to a minimum. \n    \n  \n  The LZR Racer reduces skin friction drag 24 percent more than the Fastskin, the previous Speedo racing suit fabric; and according to the manufacturer, the LZR Racer uses a Hydro Form Compression System to grip the body like a corset. Speedo experts say this compression helps the swimmers maintain the best form possible and enables them to swim longer and faster since they are using less energy to maintain form. The compression alone improves efficiency up to 5 percent, according to the manufacturer.\n  Olympic swimmer Katie Hoff, one of the American athletes wearing the suit in 2008 competitions, said that the tight suit helps a swimmer move more quickly through the water, because it “compresses [the] whole body so that [it’s] really streamlined.” Athletes from the French, Australian, and British Olympic teams all participated in testing the new Speedo racing suits.\n   Similar in style to a wetsuit, the LZR Racer can cover all or part of the legs, depending on personal preference and event. A swimmer can choose a full-body suit that covers the entire torso and extends to the ankles, or can opt for a suit with shorter legs above the knees. The more skin the LZR Racer covers, the more potential it has to reduce skin friction drag. The research seems to have paid off; in March 2008, athletes wearing the LZR Racer broke 13 world records.\n  Speedo®, LZR Pulse®, LZR Racer®, and FastSkin® are registered trademarks of Speedo Holdings B.V.\n    \n        \n        \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n      \n\n\n\n"},{"href":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/ch_5.html","text":"Immersive Photography Renders 360° Views","image":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/images/R-D_thumb_opt.jpeg","story":"\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n    \n    Consumer, Home, and Recreation\n  \n\n\n  Originating Technology/NASA Contribution\n  NASA uses 3-D immersive photography and video for guiding space robots, in the space shuttle and International Space Station programs, cryogenic wind tunnels, and for remote docking of spacecraft. It allows researchers to view situations with the same spatial awareness they would have if they were present. With this type of photography, viewers virtually enter the panoramic image and can interact with the environment by panning, looking in different directions, and zooming in on anything in the 360-degree field of view that is of interest. As the perspective changes, the viewer feels as if he or she is actually looking around the scene, which enhances situational awareness and provides a high level of functionality for viewing, capturing, and analyzing visual data. \n  Partnership\n  A Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contract through Langley Research Center helped Interactive Pictures Corporation (IPC), of Knoxville, Tennessee, create an innovative imaging technology. This technology is a video imaging process that allows real-time control of live video data and can provide users with interactive, panoramic 360° views. \n  In 1993, the year that the first IPIX camera entered the market, it also received an “R&D 100” award, a prestigious honor given by R&D magazine for significant contributions to the scientific community. \n  The camera system can see in multiple directions, provide up to four simultaneous views, each with its own tilt, rotation, and magnification, yet it has no moving parts, is noiseless, and can respond faster than the human eye. In addition, it eliminates the distortion caused by a fisheye lens, and provides a clear, flat view of each perspective.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n                Patented IPIX technology produces spherical images that let you feel like you are actually inside the scene.\n              Image courtesy of Jook Leung. \n    \n  \n  In 1995, an inventor named Ford Oxaal showed the company a technology he had developed which gives users the ability to combine two or more images, whether fisheye or rectilinear, into a single, navigable spherical image. Oxaal convinced IPIX to commercialize this useful showcasing technology, and combined with the advent of the World Wide Web, IPIX was able to execute a successful initial public offering. \n  The company has changed names at several points along the way. It started out as Telerobotics International, but changed its name to Omniview in 1995 after Oxaal showed his spherical media technology. In 1998, it became Interactive Pictures Corporation, and then later, Internet Pictures Corporation, and finally, IPIX Corporation. In 2007, Minds-Eye-View Inc., founded by Oxaal in 1989 and based in Cohoes, New York, purchased most of the operating assets of IPIX and is now in the process of taking the company and the technology to the entertainment industry. Oxaal is currently president and CEO.\n  Applications now include what Oxaal calls “homeland reconnaissance,” wherein critical infrastructure and public facilities are documented with spherical media; military reconnaissance; real estate and product showcasing; security and surveillance; and soon, interactive Webcasts. \n  Product Outcome\n  Through the NASA SBIR work, IPIX has created two 3-D immersive photography suites: a still image program and a video complement. \n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n                With NASA assistance, IPIX developed the first commercially available immersive 360-degree photography, with widespread applicability in real estate and security markets.\n            Image courtesy of Jook Leung. \n    \n  \n  The IPIX package is a convenient and powerful documentation and site management tool. It is compatible with many off-the-shelf digital cameras and the final pictures are viewable in any immersive viewing formats, giving users a handful of benefits, including ease of use and the ability to capture and save an entire spherical environment with just two shots. The two images are fused together with no discernable seam, and the viewer can navigate throughout the picture from a fixed location. This is particularly helpful for virtual tours and has been widely embraced by the real estate, hotel, and automobile industries. \n  IPIX’s immersive video suite also offers many benefits. Users can count on immersive video to capture and save digital representations of entire environments, while providing multiple simultaneous views with a single camera and no moving parts. From within the immersive video view, users can electronically pan, tilt, and zoom, while the camera remains motionless. The system also provides wide, complete coverage, with no blind spots, and the files can be transmitted efficiently over networks, even over existing, commercial IP-based platforms.\n  Both of these camera systems can be employed in virtually any situation where immersive views are needed. They have been used in casinos, airports, rail systems, parking garages, schools, banks, stores, gas stations, automobile dealerships, amusement parks, hotels, homes for sale or rent, cruise ships, warehouses, power plants, incarceration facilities, theaters, stadiums, shopping centers, military facilities, government centers, assisted living centers, hospitals, gated communities, multi-tenant complexes, manufacturing plants, museums, hospitals, office buildings, colleges and universities, courts, and convention centers, to name just a few. Potential applications, however, are limitless. \n  In 2004, IPIX security cameras were chosen for surveillance of the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston and the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York. That same year, the technology was used for surveillance at the 30th G8 Summit at Sea Island, Georgia, and during the President’s second inaugural parade in Washington, DC. More recently, the technology has been used to secure everything from the CircusCircus Las Vegas Hotel and Casino to Meade High School at Fort George G. Meade, Maryland, to the Mt. Pleasant, Illinois, City Hall. \n  The technology isn’t only applicable to safety and surveillance uses, though. It is a popular complement to real estate and hotel Web sites, where visitors can take virtual tours of properties online.\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n                      \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                      \n                      "},{"href":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/ch_6.html","text":"Historic Partnership Captures Our Imagination","image":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/images/ch-14.jpeg","story":"\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n  Consumer, Home, and Recreation\n  \n\n  \n\n  Originating Technology/NASA Contribution\n  \n    \n    \n      \n      Famous for its broadcast of greetings on Christmas Eve of 1968 as the crew circled the Moon, Apollo 8 was the first manned mission ever to reach escape velocity.

Photographs from space illustrating the planet on which we live, the space surrounding it, and the precarious voyages into it by our fellow humans are among the most tangible products of the Space Program. These images have become touchstones of successive generations, as the voyages into space have illuminated the space in which we live. \n  In 1962, Walter Schirra blasted off in a Mercury rocket to become the fifth American in space, bringing with him the first Hasselblad camera to leave the Earth’s atmosphere, recently purchased from a camera shop near Johnson Space Center in Houston—but not the last. The camera, a Hasselblad 500C, was a standard consumer unit that Schirra had stripped to bare metal and painted black in order to minimize reflections. Once in space, he documented the wonder and awe-inspiring beauty around him, and brought the images back for us to share. The Hasselblad 500C cameras were used on this and the last Project Mercury mission in 1963. They continued to be used throughout the Gemini space flights in 1965 and 1966.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n      The ELS is a modified 553 ELX, with flash metering removed and leatherette replaced with thin metal plates. This camera was used in the early 1990s on the space shuttle missions. The film magazines use 70-millimeter perforated film and are equipped with electronic data imprinting, enabling the recording of time and picture number for each exposure.\n    \n  \n  Since then, a number of different camera models have been put to use, but the images taken with the boxy, black Hasselblads have remained true classics. Noted for the amazing sharpness of the photos, the Hasselblads stood up to the rigors of operating in space, facing from -65 °C to over 120 °C in the sun. Many shots have become historic treasures: the first spacewalk during the Gemini IV mission in 1965; the first venture to another celestial body during Apollo VIII, including the iconic “Earthrise” photograph; and the first landing on the surface of the Moon during Apollo XI. These pictures were published around the world, and have become some of the most recognizable and powerful photographs known. \n  Several different models of Hasselblad cameras have been taken into space, often modified in one way or another to ease use in cramped conditions and while wearing space suits, such as replacing the reflex mirror with an eye-level finder. \n  Partnership\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n                Astronaut Buzz Aldrin, lunar module pilot of the first lunar landing mission, poses for a photograph beside the United States flag. Astronaut Neil A. Armstrong took this picture with a 70-millimeter Hasselblad lunar surface camera, one of three Hasselblad cameras the mission carried to the Moon.\n    \n  \n  Victor Hasselblad AB, of Gothenburg, Sweden, has enjoyed a very long-lived collaboration with NASA. Working primarily with Johnson, the last four decades have seen a frequent exchange of ideas between Hasselblad and NASA via faxes, telephone calls, and meetings both in Sweden and the United States. Initially, most meetings were held at Hasselblad headquarters in Gothenburg, to be as close to the core activities as possible. Since then, collaboration with NASA has allowed what was once a very small company in international terms to achieve worldwide recognition. Hassleblad’s operations now include centers in Parsippany, New Jersey; and Redmond, Washington; as well as France and Denmark. \n  One direct development of this partnership, the 553ELS, is the space version of the 553ELX model, available commercially for years. This camera has adopted several key features and improvements, such as: the fixation of the mirror mechanism was removed from the rear plate to the side walls; aluminum plating replaced the standard black leatherette as the outer covering; the standard 5-pole contact was replaced by a special 7-pole contact equipped with a bayonet locking device; and the battery cover was equipped with a hinge. These changes resulted in increased durability and reliability, and the ELS model has seen frequent use in the shuttle program. \n  Hasselblad incorporated and refined other modifications by NASA technicians into new models, such as a 70mm magazine developed to meet Space Program needs. Camera modifications included new materials and lubricants to cope with the vacuum conditions outside the spacecraft, and often improved reliability and durability of the cameras. In addition, technicians modified camera electronics to meet NASA’s special demands for handling and function, reconstructing lenses and adding large tabs to the focusing and aperture rings to ease handling with the large gloves of an astronaut suit in zero gravity.\n  Product Outcome\n  \n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n      Earth resembles a child’s marble in this amazing photo, taken during the Apollo 17 mission. NASA officially credits the image to the entire crew, Eugene Cernan, Ronald Evans, and Jack Schmitt, all of whom took photographic images with the onboard Hasselblad.\n      On February 7, 1984, astronaut Robert Gibson used a Hasselblad camera to take this picture of astronaut Bruce McCandless II, when he became the first person to fly untethered in space. McCandless traveled more than 300 feet from the Space Shuttle Challenger, 150 nautical miles above Earth.\n    \n  \n  For over four decades, Hasselblad has supplied camera equipment to the NASA Space Program, and Hasselblad cameras still take on average between 1,500 and 2,000 photographs on each space shuttle mission. Just as the remarkable pictures on the surface of the Moon defined an era, the fine pictures of astronauts at work in and around the shuttles and International Space Station (ISS) have helped define the latest era of man’s continued exploration of the universe around us.\n  Likewise, the commercial line of Hasselblad cameras continues to incorporate lessons learned from these voyages. Consumer models have enjoyed such refinements as the revised fixation of the mirror mechanism—the Hasselblad 503CW still features the space-influenced improved mirror mechanism—a design change that gave far better stability for the mirror assembly, and an enlarged exposure button, similar to the one designed for the space models. \n  In October 2001, the Space Shuttle Discovery, in addition to transporting modules to the ISS, carried a new Hasselblad space camera: a focal-plane shutter camera based on the standard commercial version (203FE) equipped with data imprinting along the edge of the film frame, enabling the recording of time and picture number for each exposure. Since the computers onboard have full control over the position of the shuttle, identification of the exact location captured in a frame has become much easier.\n  Now that NASA is returning to the Moon and is also looking on to Mars for the next stage of exploration, it is without doubt that Hasselblad cameras will be along to document the voyages for those of us remaining on Earth. The relationship that began in a camera shop in Houston, blossomed on the Moon, and matured on the space shuttle, now prepares to reach new heights. As one more small step for a man and giant leap for mankind approaches, we anxiously await the photographs.\n  \n  \n\n                      \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                      \n                      "},{"href":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/ch_7.html","text":"Outboard Motor Maximizes Power and Dependability","image":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/images/ch19.jpeg","story":"\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n  \n  Consumer, Home, and Recreation\n  \n\n\n  Originating Technology/NASA Contribution\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Jonathan Lee, a structural materials engineer at Marshall Space Flight Center was on the team that developed MSFC-398, a high-strength aluminum alloy now being used in high-performance marine outboard engines. \n    \n  \n  Developed by Jonathan Lee, a structural materials engineer at Marshall Space Flight Center, and PoShou Chen, a scientist with Huntsville, Alabama-based Morgan Research Corporation, MSFC-398 is a high-strength aluminum alloy able to operate at high temperatures. The invention was conceived through a program with the Federal government and a major automobile manufacturer called the Partnership for Next Generation Vehicles. While the success of MSFC-398 can partly be attributed to its strength and resistance to wear, another key aspect is the manufacturing process: the metal is capable of being produced in high volumes at low cost, making it attractive to commercial markets. \n  Since its premiere, the high-strength aluminum alloy has received several accolades, including being named Marshall’s “Invention of the Year” in 2003, receiving the Society of Automotive Engineering’s “Environmental Excellence in Transportation Award” in 2004, the Southeast Regional Federal Laboratory Consortium “Excellence in Technology Transfer Award” in 2005, and the National Federal Laboratory Consortium’s “Excellence in Technology Transfer Award” in 2006. \n  Realizing the potential commercial applicability of MSFC-398, Marshall introduced it for public licensing in 2001. The alloy’s subsequent success is particularly apparent in its widespread application in commercial marine products. \n  Partnership\n  A worldwide leader in the design, development, and distribution of a wide variety of land and water vehicles, including outboard motors, Bombardier Recreational Products (BRP) Inc., came across a description of the NASA alloy and was immediately intrigued. The Canada-based company decided to meet with NASA in April 2001, to explore how the technology could strengthen its products. BRP and NASA identified an application for high-performance outboard engine pistons. Prototype production started in July, and the Boats and Outboard Engines Division of BRP, based in Sturtevant, Wisconsin, signed the licensing agreement exactly 1 year later.\n  “Having a proper mixture of the alloy’s composition with the correct heat treatment process are two crucial steps to create this alloy for high-temperature applications,” said Lee. “The team at Bombardier worked hard with the casting vendor and NASA inventors to perfect the casting of pistons, learn and repeat the process, and bring its product to market. Chen and I are honored to see something we invented being used in a commercial product in a very rapid pace. We still have to pinch ourselves occasionally to realize that BRP’s commercialization effort for this alloy has become a reality. It’s happened so quickly.”\n  “The usual cycle for developing this type of technology, from the research stage to the development phase, and finally into a commercial product phase may take several years and more than a $1 million investment,” Lee said. In this case, it occurred in fewer than 4 years and at a fraction of that cost. \n  BRP also applauded NASA for its prompt assistance. “The demands of the outboard engine are more significant than any other engine NASA had ever encountered,” claims Denis Morin, the company’s vice president of engineering, outboard engines. “The team from NASA was on the fast track, learned all the intricacies, and delivered an outstanding product.” BRP incorporated the alloy pistons into a brand new mid-power outboard motor that the company affirms is “years beyond carbureted two-stroke, four-stroke, or even direct injection” engines.\n  Product Outcome\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      The Evinrude E-TEC line of outboard engines uses a NASA-derived aluminum alloy. \n    \n  \n  While a four-stroke engine generally runs cleaner and quieter than its two-stroke counterpart, it lacks the power and dependability; and the two-stroke engine, which generally contains 200 fewer parts than a comparable four-stroke motor, literally has fewer things that can go wrong. Evinrude E-TEC is a line of two-stroke motors that maintain the power and dependability of a two-stroke with the refinement of a four-stroke. The Evinrude E-TEC is also the first outboard motor that will not require oil changes, winterization, spring tune-ups, or scheduled maintenance for 3 years of normal recreational use. It incorporates the NASA alloy into its pistons, significantly improving durability at high temperatures while also making the engine quieter, cleaner, and more efficient.\n  The E-TEC features a low-friction design completely free from belts, powerhead gears, cams, and mechanical oil pumps; a “sure-start” ignition system that prevents spark plug fouling and does not require priming or choking; and speed-adjusting failsafe electronics that keep it running even if a boat’s battery dies. A central computer controls the outboard engine’s single injector, which is completely sealed to prevent air from entering the fuel system and thus minimizes evaporative emissions. Furthermore, the E-TEC auto-lubing oil system eliminates the process of having to mix oil with fuel, while complete combustion precludes virtually any oil from escaping into the environment. When programmed to operate on specially designed oil, the E-TEC uses approximately 50 percent less oil than a traditional direct injection system and 75 percent less than a traditional two-stroke engine. Additionally, when compared to a four-stroke engine, the E-TEC creates 80 percent less carbon monoxide while idle. \n  As an added bonus for fishermen, the new piston design also reduces the slapping sound usually made when pistons slide up and down in the engine’s cylinder, a sure sign to fish that someone is coming for them with a worm on a hook. \n  Ranging from 40-horsepower (hp) models to 300-hp models, Evinrude E-TEC engines won the prestigious “2003 Innovation Award” from the National Marine Manufacturers Association at the annual Miami International Boat Show, and are the only marine engines to have ever received the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s “Clean Air Technology Excellence Award.” \n  E-TEC also received a testimonial from an individual who put the engine to an incredible test in the most unusual of conditions: While BRP often hears from boaters who depend on its engines in tropical, warm, and temperate climates, the company had heard about an individual from the small Alaskan village of Koyukuk who runs the Yukon River with his Evinrude just about everyday, from break-up of the iced-over body of water to freeze-up during the long Alaskan winter. The nearest “sizable” town is 400 miles upstream from Koyukuk, so the turbid and turgid river serves as the only “highway” on which to acquire goods, tools, and groceries.

Obstacles include maintaining long-term food supplies, ensuring access to clean air and potable water, and developing efficient means of waste disposal—all with the constraints of being in a spacecraft thousands of miles from Earth, and getting farther every minute. NASA continues to overcome these hurdles, though, and is in the process of designing increasingly efficient life support systems to make life aboard the International Space Station sustainable for laboratory crews, and creating systems for use on future lunar laboratories and the upcoming long trip to Mars. \n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Shown here is the Skylab food heating and serving tray with food, drink, and utensils. While this represented a great improvement over the food served on earlier space flights, NASA researchers still had plenty of room for progress. \n    \n  \n  Ideal life support systems for these closed environments would take up very little space, consume very little power, and require limited crew intervention—these much-needed components would virtually disappear while doing their important jobs. One NASA experiment into creating a low-profile life support system involved living ecosystems in contained environments. Dubbed the Controlled Ecological Life Support Systems (CELSS) these contained systems attempted to address the basic needs of crews, meet stringent payload and power usage restrictions, and minimize space occupancy by developing living, regenerative ecosystems that would take care of themselves and their inhabitants—recreating Earth-like conditions. \n  Years later, what began as an experiment with different methods of bioregenerative life support for extended-duration, human-crewed space flight, has evolved into one of the most widespread NASA spinoffs of all time. \n  Partnership\n  In the 1980s, Baltimore-based Martin Marietta Corporation worked with NASA to test the use of certain strains of microalgae as a food supply, oxygen source, and a catalyst for waste disposal as part of the CELSS experiments. The plan was for the microalgae to become part of the life support system on long-duration flights, taking on a plethora of tasks with minimal space, energy, and maintenance requirements. During this research, the scientists discovered many things about the microalgae, realizing ultimately that its properties were valuable to people not only in space, but here on Earth, as a nutritional supplement. The scientists, fueled by these discoveries, spun off from Martin Marietta, and in 1985, formed Martek Biosciences Corporation, in Columbia, Maryland. \n  Product Outcome\n  Now, after two decades of continued research on the same microalgae studied for use in long-duration space flight, Martek has developed into a major player in the nutrition field, with over 500 employees and annual revenue of more than $270 million. The reach of the company’s space-developed product, though, is what is most impressive. Martek’s main products, life’sDHA and life’sARA, both of which trace directly back to the original NASA CELSS work, can be found in over 90 percent of the infant formulas sold in the United States, and are added to the infant formulas sold in over 65 additional countries. With such widespread use, the company estimates that over 24 million babies worldwide have consumed its nutritional additives.\n  Outside of the infant formula market, Martek’s commercial partners include General Mills Inc., Yoplait USA Inc., Odwalla Inc., Kellogg Company, and Dean Foods Company’s WhiteWave Foods division (makers of the Silk, Horizon Organic, and Rachel’s brands). \n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      NASA experiments into plant growth for long-duration space flights led to the identification and manufacturing method for a nutritional supplement now found in everyday foods.\n    \n  \n  Why would so many people consume these products? The primary ingredient is one of the building blocks of health: A fatty acid found in human breast milk, known to improve brain function and visual development, which recent studies have indicated plays a significant role in heart health. It is only introduced to the body through dietary sources, so supplements containing it are in high demand. \n  The primary discovery Martek made while exploring properties of microalgae for use in long-duration space flights was identifying Crypthecodinium cohnii, a strain of algae that produces docosahexaenoc acid (DHA) naturally and in high quantities. Using the same principles, the company also patented a method for developing another fatty acid that plays a key role in infant health, arachidonic acid (ARA). This fatty acid, it extracts from the fungus Mortierella alpina.\n  DHA is an omega-3 fatty acid, naturally found in the body, which plays a key role in infant development and adult health. Most abundant in the brain, eyes, and heart, it is integral in learning ability, mental development, visual acuity, and in the prevention and management of cardiovascular disease. \n  Approximately 60 percent of the brain is composed of structural fat (the gray matter), of which nearly half is composed of DHA. As such, it is an essential building block for early brain development, as well as a key structural element in maintaining healthy brain functioning through all stages of life. It is especially important in infancy, though, when the most rapid brain growth occurs—the human brain nearly triples in size during the first year of life. Breast milk, which is generally two-thirds fat, is a chief source for DHA for children, both a testament to the body’s need for this substance and an argument for sustainable sources that can be added to infant formula. Studies have shown that adults, too, need DHA for healthy brain functioning, and that the important chemical is delivered through the diet. \n  DHA is also a key component in the structural fat that makes up the eye, and is vital for visual development and ocular health. The retina, for example, contains a high concentration of DHA, which the body forms from nutritious fats in the diet. With heart tissue, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has found supporting evidence that DHA consumption may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease. \n  This important compound, previously only found in human breast milk, and with undeniable nutritional value, is now available throughout the world. It is one example of how NASA research intended to sustain life in space has found its way back to Earth, where it is improving the lives of people everywhere.\n  life’sDHA™ and life’sARA™ are trademarks of Martek Biosciences Corporation.\n  Silk®, Horizon Organic®, and Rachel’s® are registered trademarks of the WhiteWave Foods Company. \n\n  \n  \n\n                      \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                      \n                      "},{"href":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/ch_9.html","text":"Aerogels Insulate Missions and Consumer Products","image":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/images/R-D_thumb_opt.jpeg","story":"\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n    \n    Consumer, Home, and Recreation\n  \n\n\n  Originating Technology/NASA Contribution\n  Recently, NASA’s Stardust mission used a block of aerogel to catch high-speed comet particles and specks of interstellar dust without damaging them, by slowing down the particles from their high velocity with minimal heating or other effects that would cause their physical alteration. This amazing accomplishment, bringing space particles back to Earth, was made possible by the equally amazing properties of aerogel.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n                Aerogel has many uses within NASA. For example, it was the perfect lightweight medium for capturing interstellar and comet dust particles during NASA’s Stardust mission.\n    \n  \n  Due to its extremely light weight and often translucent appearance, aerogel is often called solid smoke. Barely denser than air, this smoky material weighs virtually nothing. In fact, it holds the world record for being the world’s lightest solid—one of 15 records granted it by Guinness World Records. It is truly an amazing substance: able to hold up under temperatures of 3,000 °F. Aerogels have unsurpassed thermal insulation values (providing three times more insulation than the best fiberglass), as well as astounding sound and shock absorption characteristics. \n  As a class, aerogels, composed of silicone dioxide and 99.8 percent air, have the highest thermal insulation value, the highest specific surface area, the lowest density, the lowest speed of sound, the lowest refractive index, and the lowest dielectric constant of all solid materials. They are also extremely fragile. Similar in chemical structure to glass, though 1,000 times less dense, they are often prone to breaking when handling—seemingly their only drawback—aside from their cost.\n  Invented nearly 80 years ago, aerogels are typically hard-to-handle and costly to manufacture by traditional means. For these reasons, the commercial industry found it difficult to manufacture products incorporating the material. However, a small business partnered with NASA to develop a flexible aerogel concept and a revolutionary manufacturing method that cut production time and costs, while also solving the handling problems associated with aerogel-based insulation products. \n  These robust, flexible forms of aerogel can now be manufactured into blankets, thin sheets, beads, and molded parts. \n  James Fesmire, senior principal investigator at Kennedy Space Center’s Cryogenics Test Laboratory, and one of the key inventors of this new technology, says of the advancements, “This aerogel blanket insulation is not only the world’s best insulator, but, combined with its favorable environmental and mechanical characteristics, also opens the door to many new design possibilities for buildings, cars, electrical power, and many industrial process systems.”\n  Partnership\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n                Flexible insulating blankets come in a variety of shapes and sizes, lending themselves to many different applications.\n    \n  \n  Aspen Aerogels Inc., of Northborough, Massachusetts, an independent company spun off from Aspen Systems Inc., rose to the challenge of creating a robust, flexible form of aerogel by working with NASA through a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contract with Kennedy. That contract led to further partnerships for the development of thermal insulation materials, manufacturing processes, and new test methods. This collaboration over many years was a pivotal part for the founding of NASA’s Cryogenics Test Laboratory.\n  Aspen responded to NASA’s need for a flexible, durable, easy-to-use aerogel system for cryogenic insulation for space shuttle launch applications. For NASA, the final product of this low thermal conductivity system was useful in applications such as launch vehicles, space shuttle upgrades, and life support equipment. The company has since used the same manufacturing process developed under the SBIR to expand its product offerings into the more commercial realms, making aerogel available for the first time as a material that can be handled and installed just like standard insulation. The development process culminated in an “R&D 100” award for Aspen Aerogels and Kennedy in 2003.\n  According to Fesmire, “This flexible aerogel insulation idea originated 16 years ago. The problem was to make the world’s best insulation material in an easy-to-use form at an affordable price. All these goals have now been achieved through many years of dedicated work.” \n  Product Outcome\n  Based on its work with NASA, Aspen has developed three different lines of aerogel products: Cryogel, Spaceloft, and Pyrogel. Its work has also infused back into the Space Program, as Kennedy is an important customer. \n  Cryogel is a flexible insulation, with or without integral vapor barrier, for sub-ambient temperature and cryogenic pipelines, vessels, and equipment. It comes as flexible aerogel blanket insulation engineered to deliver maximum thermal protection with minimal weight and thickness and zero water vapor permeability. Its unique properties—extremely low thermal conductivity, superior flexibility, compression resistance, hydrophobicity, and ease of use—make it an ideal thermal protection for cryogenic applications.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n                Aspen’s insulating aerogels have been incorporated into extreme weather gear, where they are prized for both their light weight and extreme insulating performance. \n    \n  \n  Spaceloft also comes in flexible blanket form and is easy to use. (It can be cut using conventional textile cutting tools, including scissors, electric scissors, and razor knives.) It is designed to meet the demanding requirements of industrial, commercial, and residential applications. Spaceloft is a proven, effective insulator in the oil and gas industries, building and construction, aerospace, automotive, cold chain, and other industries requiring maximum thermal protection within tight space and weight constraints. Spaceloft is used for low-pressure steam pipes, vessels, and equipment; sub-sea pipelines, hot pipes, vessels, and equipment; footwear and outdoor apparel. Other applications include tents, insulation for interior wall renovation, mobile home exteriors, tractor heat shielding, bus heat shielding, hot water pipes, and solar panels.\n  Pyrogel is used in medium-to-high pressure steam pipes, vessels, and equipment; aerospace and defense applications; fire barriers; welding blankets; footwear and outdoor apparel. Applications have included insulating an entire polycarbonate plant, a reactor exterior, high- altitude boots, water and gas piping, tubing bundles, yacht exhausts, large vessels, exhaust ducts, ships’ boilers, and underground steam lines. The insulation has been proven to be an effective underfoot barrier to extreme cold in the form of insoles for climbers on Mt. Everest, where their light weight and flexibility are also prized. They have even been tested as insoles for ultramarathoners—runners who jog past the 26.2 mile standard marathon distance and sometimes up to 100 miles at a time—who prize the material for its light weight and excellent heat- insulating properties. \n  It is not just industry and the commercial realm that are benefiting from Aspen’s products, though. The work has come full circle, and Aspen is a regular provider of aerogel insulation to NASA, where the material is used on many diverse projects, for space shuttle applications, interplanetary propulsion, and life support equipment. On the space shuttle, it is used as an insulation on the external tank vent’s quick-disconnect valve, which releases at liftoff and reaches temperatures of -400 °F. It is also found on the shuttle launch pad’s fuel cell systems.

Specialized digital photographs of Earth’s continents and surrounding coastal regions have helped people study many aspects of our planet and analyze and protect the environment. Resolution and commercial availability of remote sensing through satellite imagery has improved dramatically over the years, and we are now seeing application in a very specific and largely unknown form of environmental threat detection: waste tire piles. \n  Illegal scrap tire piles are generally considered an environmental hazard because they can become breeding grounds for rodents and mosquitoes and can also generate fumes and toxic fires that are difficult and costly to extinguish. Tires also cause problems in landfills because they settle unevenly and rise to the surface; 38 states ban whole tires from landfills, but most allow tires if they are shredded. Although markets exist for most of the 299 million scrap tires discarded every year in the United States, approximately 40 million scrap tires end up in landfills or in illegal scrap tire piles. In California alone, at least 8 million scrap tires are dumped illegally every year. Although the number of tires in stockpiles has dropped by more than half from the 1994 levels of 700 to 800 million, cleaning up these piles is expensive and, until recently, the illegal piles were especially difficult to locate. \n  Partnership\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n                Becky Quinlan, of Endpoint Environmental LLC, calibrates the TIRe Model by recording the location of known tire piles.\n    \n  \n  Catherine Huybrechts Burton founded San Francisco-based Endpoint Environmental (2E) LLC in 2005 while she was a student intern and project manager at Ames Research Center with NASA’s DEVELOP program, which sponsors student internships in applying Earth science data and technology to local policy issues. During that time, the California Integrated Waste Management Board (CIWMB) proposed a pilot project to NASA: develop a new method for mapping waste tire piles. While Burton surveyed environmental agencies for products already available for locating tire piles, her colleague, Becky Quinlan, developed a software model. They determined that neither satellite imagery nor image processing models were being used to locate tire piles.\n  Using a mapping algorithm called the Egeria densa Image Processing Algorithm (EDIPA), which Burton created for her master’s thesis, the 2E team created the Tire Identification from Reflectance (TIRe) Model, which algorithmically processes images using turnkey technology to retain only the darkest parts of an image; this allows researchers to find tire piles far more quickly than if they scan images conventionally. “We take that image with the tires and other dark objects and place it on top of the original image,” Burton explains. “It is at this point that the highly trained visual image interpreter must determine what is a pile of tires and what is not.” \n  The low reflectivity of tire piles complicates their detection in photographs and makes the process of finding them more difficult due to the fact that they are easily confused with other dark images in digital photographs. 2E researchers use the TIRe Model to identify specific dark pixels in satellite images, systematically ruling out known features or objects, such as runways, parking lots, shadows, polluted waters, and objects made with recycled tire materials, such as roofs, tubing, and playgrounds. Analysts consider the remaining dark areas suspect, and assume they are probably tire piles, says Burton. The TIRe Model is so finely tuned that it can identify piles containing only 100 tires covering 36 square feet, due to the high resolution of the satellite images. \n  CIWMB tested the TIRe Model on sites in the coastal area of Sonoma, the desert climate of the Coachella Valley in Southeastern California, and the Lucerne Valley. Without prior knowledge of the locations, 2E located all illegal scrap tire piles targeted by CIWMB, and also located two previously unknown piles. 2E used high-resolution satellite imagery from GeoEye’s IKONOS satellite, which provides 4 meters per pixel, superior to most other satellite imagery that offer 30 meters per pixel.\n   To improve their analysis, Burton and Quinlan applied specific knowledge of the different climates and of how tire piles were used in specific areas, for instance, as windbreaks, fences, and in gullies to control erosion. 2E did not use thresholding, a common method of separating image features, because the data for tires varies too much between different images. In order to separate tires visually, 2E used a land/water index to eliminate vegetation and water features, and then analyzed hues to eliminate soil and any additional water features. Using these techniques, 2E eliminated 99 percent of the false positives in the satellite images.\n  After Burton and Quinlan’s contracts with NASA concluded, NASA granted 2E’s request to share rights to the TIRe Model. 2E has since presented the TIRe Model at several conferences: the American Geophysical Union and the American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (2005); the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Resource Conservation Challenge at the CIWMB (2006); the Cross-Border Environmental Management Conference at the University of Texas at Austin (2007); the Indiana Geographic Information Council Conference (2007); and the California “CalGIS” Conference (2007).\n  Product Outcome\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n                Smoke rises from burning tires on the western shore of Lake Michigan. The TIRe Model processes satellite images to locate illegal tire piles and prevent these environmental hazards.\n    \n  \n  Before 2E developed the TIRe Model, methods available for identifying tire piles included aerial and spectral video analysis, but no formal commercial models were available. The TIRe Model now helps state governments and private industry to locate and monitor tire piles, whether legal or illegal. Many states have already cleaned up large numbers of stockpiles, which is partly due to the growing market for reprocessed tire products (such as tire-derived fuel, civil engineering, and rubber-modified asphalt). By the end of 2005, according to the most recent report from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), seven states contained 84 percent of all scrap tires: Colorado, New York, Texas, Connecticut, Alabama, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. \n  In 2007, 2E worked on a project with San Francisco State University to map tire sites in Northern California and along the California-Mexico border. Because many tires are disposed of illegally by Americans in Mexico, there is a fair amount of interest in locating tire piles along the border. In addition to offering their tire mapping services to California, Indiana, and the EPA, Endpoint Environmental is also negotiating with a private company in Wyoming. Several industry publications have published articles on 2E’s tire finding services. 2E is also using Burton’s original EDIPA model and the TIRe Model to locate invasive plant species.\n    \n    \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n      \n\n  \n"},{"href":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/er_2.html","text":"Battery Technology Stores Clean Energy ","image":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/images/R-D_thumb_opt.jpeg","story":"\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n     \n      Environmental and Agricultural Resources\n  \n\n\n  Originating Technology/NASA Contribution\n  Affordable and reliable clean energy has been a tantalizing, but elusive, quarry. Featured in Spinoff 1985 and pioneered by Lawrence Thaller at Lewis (now Glenn) Research Center in the 1970s as a potential alternate energy source for long-term space flight, iron-chromium redox energy storage systems are a hybrid technology that offers the extended support of fuel cells with the flexibility of batteries. They act as “electron buckets” for existing clean energy sources, such as solar or wind, to store and deliver power predictably when needed. \n  In iron-chromium redox systems, electricity is generated when pumps move the electrolytes into separate sections of a reaction chamber. Electrodes collect that charge, and the electrolytes can then be recharged from an outside power source. Thaller’s initial design was a 1-kilowatt system (2 kilowatts at its peak), which used acidified chromium and iron in its solution and relied on soluble redox couples and an ion exchange membrane to generate and store energy in a liquid electrolyte solution. \n  Partnership\n  Headquartered in Fremont, California (with offices in Gurgaon, India), Deeya Energy Inc. is now bringing its iron-chromium hybrid flow batteries to commercial customers around the world. Thaller supported Deeya’s founder, Saroj Sahu, providing development assistance for the company’s proprietary liquid-cells (l-cells.) The l-cells have higher power capability (3 kilowatts) than Thaller’s original design, and in January 2008, the Space Foundation approved the l-cells as a Certified Space Technology, a designation for products made possible by space research and development.\n  Product Outcome\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n                Load-leveling liquid redox systems originated as potential energy storage for long-term space flight. \n    \n  \n  According to Rick Winter, an engineer and vice president with the company, Deeya’s l-cells offer a few fundamental differences from the original redox system. “With the advent of modern plastics, we have been able to replace critical components, dramatically improving the system’s performance, cost, and life,” Winter explains. “We have improved the reliability and reduced the component count and cost so that it can be commercially competitive.” Deeya l-cells are effectively 3 times less expensive than lead-acid batteries and 10 to 20 times less expensive than nickel-metal hydride batteries, lithium-ion batteries, and fuel cell options. The system represents a clean energy technology with no poisonous or expensive metals or fumes release.\n  Like the original redox system, l-cells offer several advantages over traditional lead-acid batteries: lower cost, longer life, small space needs, and excellent performance at high ambient temperatures. Because l-cells, according to Winter, “actually enjoy sitting in the sun,” rural communities in India with power supply problems have expressed interest in the technology. Deeya has tested the l-cells in air temperatures up to 120 °F, and offer significantly better performance than lead-acid, which only perform reliably in moderately cool temperatures. L-cells also have the ability to operate for thousands of discharge cycles without boost charging, as opposed to the current generation of rechargeable batteries, which are only good for 200 to 500 deep discharge cycles. \n   Deeya l-cells store energy within the electrolyte itself, with no solid materials, such as lead-oxide, required. This approach completely decouples the power and energy ratings of the systems. As such, system power is defined by the size of the electrode stacks, and available energy depends only on the size of the electrolyte tanks. Due to the low cost of the active materials, the technology lends itself to applications needing extended support times. Deeya l-cells also have no harmful metals or fumes and are completely recyclable, making them a clean replacement for lead-acid batteries and diesel generators. The most impressive difference between Deeya l-cells and lead-acid batteries, however, is the life expectancy. Under standard use, lead-acid batteries tend to need replacement every 18 months, whereas Deeya l-cells need refurbishing only every 7 years after which they can last indefinitely. In heavy use applications, they are expected to provide three times the life of lead-acid batteries.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n          The size of large refrigerators, Deeya Energy’s l-cells can provide backup power to standard cell towers for 4 hours.\n      \n    \n  \n  Deeya is now building the “smallest flow batteries in the industry,” focusing on 2-kilowatt applications. Flow batteries, a form of rechargeable battery in which electrolytes flow through a power cell, are often used in load leveling for clean technologies such as wind and solar power that sometimes have intermittent drops in power. Such systems need backup storage methods to even out the high and low periods of demand and energy generation. “With today’s intense interest in energy independence and renewable energy sources,” Winter says, “we should expect to see many full-scale commercial products changing the energy landscape in the next few years.” \n  According to Winter, Deeya flow batteries can support a standard cell tower for 4 hours with a unit that is “the size of a large refrigerator.” Deeya’s customers include cell phone providers in India who need smaller backup systems for their cell towers. Because of the backup l-cell battery systems, customers see improved reliability of services, including fewer dropped calls and fewer power outages. Other uses for l-cells could include backup systems for cash machines and traffic lights. \n  Another large-scale application can be found on King Island, near Australia’s Tasmania, where residents installed similar technology to supplement their wind turbine energy farm; they saw a significant reduction in power outages and fuel costs. Flow batteries reduced the island’s carbon dioxide emissions by 2,000 tons per year. \n  Deeya plans to install many more systems in rural areas in the developing world to provide for improved communications and significant emissions reductions. Plans include “power-station-in-a-box” products for village electrification, combining solar and wind generation sources. Multimegawatt systems will then be developed for large-scale grid-connected applications, since flow cells can improve the operational efficiency and emissions of coal- and gas-fired power plants.\n  These customers also appreciate the fact that it is easy to increase capacity—by adding more electrolytes—at a relatively low cost. In the long term, Deeya plans to expand into large 50-megawatt batteries. “The bigger the tank, the longer you can support a load,” Winter explains. Pacific Gas and Electric Company and Southern California Edison are both exploring use of these large electricity storage applications using flow batteries for backup systems to wind turbines.\n    \n    \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n      \n\n\n"},{"href":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/er_3.html","text":"Robots Explore the Farthest Reaches of Earth and Space","image":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/images/er-5.gif","story":"\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n  Environmental and Agricultural Resources\n  \n\n\n  Originating Technology/NASA Contribution\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n                Deep Ocean Engineering Inc. provides robotic solutions for various underwater applications in harsh and diverse operating environments. DOE has been in continuous operation for 25 years and has sold more than 500 ROV systems in over 30 countries worldwide.\n    \n  \n  “We were the first that ever burst/Into that silent sea,” the title character recounts in Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s opus Rime of the Ancient Mariner. This famous couplet is equally applicable to undersea exploration today as surface voyages then, and has recently been applied to space travel in the title of a chronicle of the early years of human space flight (“Into That Silent Sea: Trailblazers of the Space Era, 1961-1965”), companion to the “In the Shadow of the Moon” book and movie. The parallel is certainly fitting, considering both fields explore unknown, harsh, and tantalizingly inhospitable environments. \n  For starters, exploring the Briny Deep and the Final Frontier requires special vehicles, and the most economical and safest means for each employ remotely operated vehicles (ROVs). ROVs have proven the tool of choice for exploring remote locations, allowing scientists to explore the deepest part of the sea and the furthest reaches of the solar system with the least weight penalty, the most flexibility and specialization of design, and without the need to provide for sustaining human life, or the risk of jeopardizing that life. \n  Most NASA probes, including the historic Voyager I and II spacecraft and especially the Mars rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, feature remote operation, but new missions and new planetary environments will demand new capabilities from the robotic explorers of the future. NASA has an acute interest in the development of specialized ROVs, as new lessons learned on Earth can be applied to new environments and increasingly complex missions in the future of space exploration.\n  Partnership\n  Deep Ocean Engineering (DOE) Inc., of San Leandro, California, designs and manufactures a complete range of underwater ROV systems. Founded in 1982, DOE has over 25 years of continuous operating experience in providing a wide range of innovative and cost-effective robotic solutions. Over 500 ROV systems have been designed, built, and delivered to hundreds of customers in over 30 countries.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n              Configured submersible delivery systems also integrate a wide variety of sensors, tools, electronic navigational controls and tracking systems, instrumentation packages, and accessories.\n    \n  \n  During the 1990s, DOE received the first of several Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contracts from NASA to develop ROV technologies. Since many of those technologies are similar to what astronauts might use in space, the firm first worked on an ROV that could test enhanced human interfaces through an SBIR contract with Ames Research Center. \n  NASA recently followed this work with a Phase II SBIR contract, exploring the research and development of a versatile apparatus and method for remote robot mobility. Robotics intended for exploration of extremely remote and harsh environments must be extraordinarily versatile as well as robust. They must be able to perform in and adapt to unknown and highly variable physical surroundings—robots with tracks, wheels, or articulating legs can provide effective mobility on certain kinds of terrain. However, these same robots would likely fail if their mission requirements included roving over roughly contoured surfaces or in water, sand, slush, or ice. \n  DOE engineers developed a concept for a versatile and robust locomotion methodology based on snake and worm morphologies. This “super snake” has the ability to transition seamlessly from one environment to another, such as land to water, to burrowing into soft sediment. \n  Field experiments with this robot include sites such as San Francisco Bay, California’s Mono Lake, and desert environments such as Death Valley. The prototype equipment will be used by NASA on future projects, such as scientific research in the Dry Valley lakes of Antarctica, and experiments to evaluate concepts for exploration of Mars and Jupiter’s moon, Europa.\n  Product Outcome\n  The Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) has teamed with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on an Antarctic research project to study chemical and biological characteristics of icebergs. Because of the danger involved in getting too close to the icebergs, the team has been using a Deep Ocean DS2 ROV. The DS2 (two motor) ROV started life as a delivery to NASA in 1998, and has been on loan to MBARI. The ROV is in the process of being modified to become a DS4 (four motor), including additional thruster/motors and additional flotation. \n  Michael Gilson, vice president of Customer Solutions for DOE, explained the members of the Phantom family of ROVs: “The DS2 is a deeper-diving version of the S2 and the DS4 is a deeper version of the S4,” he said. “Unlike [with] a diver, depth is not a limiting factor, nor is water temperature or clarity of the water.”\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n                DOE’s ROV systems have been utilized in a broad range of industry applications, including military, security, salvage, long tunnel and pipeline inspection, customs, and nuclear and hydroelectric power plants.\n    \n  \n  The DS2 has an array of sensors that includes two suction samplers, a water sampler, plankton net, dissolved oxygen sensor, water speed sensor, two cameras (SIT and HD), three-function manipulator, and a tracking system. The Phantom family includes more than 70 deliveries in many countries for applications including military, archeology, science, oil and gas, and ship hull inspection. \n  Once the ROV is deployed in the water, the operator controls it and the attached instruments from the surface. From helping to recover drowning victims to inspecting off-shore oil platforms and gathering intelligence, DOE’s ROVs have many underwater uses. The U.S. armed forces use the ROVs in security measures and intelligence gathering, and Hydro Quebec—Canada’s largest electric utility and second largest corporation, which generates more than 95 percent of its production from hydroelectric facilities—uses a DOE ROV to inspect dams and hydroelectric apparatus for damage, saving an estimated $10 million in two seasons. More than 40 universities and scientific organizations conduct marine studies with the ROVs.\n  After more than 3 years of engineering design and development, including extensive discussions with customers worldwide, DOE launched the VectorROV product family. The state-of-the-art Vector family has three models to meet unique customer requirements. For example, the Vector L4 has been designed to meet the requirements of military, maritime, power generation, offshore petroleum, and scientific applications, and combines superior power, telemetry, and payload with ease of use, ruggedness, and reliability. \n  The power and control system for the Vector L4 is designed for simplicity and ease of use, with multiple microprocessors providing redundancy and expanded capabilities. The design incorporates intuitive, computer-aided, always active diagnostics facilitating maintenance of the system in the harshest environments by technicians with a minimum of training. Specifically designed high-performance brushless thrusters provide the highest power-to-weight ratio and reliability compared to other vehicles in its class. The Vector L4 graphical user interface with multiple menu screens provides intuitive feedback and active user control for ease of vehicle handling, navigation, collection and display of sensor data, as well as setting and storing custom system configurations.\n  Fabricated using modern marine-grade aluminum and composite materials, the chassis is modular with quick access to all the parts for ease of servicing and replacement as required. Constructed from polypropylene, the chassis is resilient, non-corroding, and maintenance free.

For the sake of efficient and safe long-term space travel, NASA constantly seeks to improve the process of filtering and re-using wastewater in closed-loop systems. Because it would be impractical for astronauts to bring months (or years) worth of water with them, reducing the weight and space taken by water storage through recycling and filtering as much water as possible is crucial. Closed-loop systems using nanotechnology allow wastewater to be cleaned and reused while keeping to a minimum the amount of drinking water carried on missions. \n  Current high-speed filtration methods usually require electricity, and methods without electricity usually prove impractical or slow. Known for their superior strength and electrical conductivity, carbon nanotubes measure only a few nanometers in diameter; a nanometer is one billionth of a meter, or roughly one hundred-thousandth the width of a human hair. Nanotubes have improved water filtration by eliminating the need for chemical treatments, significant pressure, and heavy water tanks, which makes the new technology especially appealing for applications where small, efficient, lightweight materials are required, whether on Earth or in space. \n  “NASA will need small volume, effective water purification systems for future long-duration space flight,” said Johnson Space Center’s Karen Pickering. NASA advances in water filtration with nanotechnology are now also protecting human health in the most remote areas of Earth.\n  Partnership\n  In 2003, Seldon Laboratories LLC, of Windsor, Vermont, received their first NASA Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) award for a “Nanomechanical Water Purification Device.” In Phase I, Seldon designed a filtration system using its proprietary filters with low-energy and low-space requirements, using carbon nanotubes to reduce the power requirements of closed-loop water (and other liquid) treatment systems and to eliminate hazardous chemical treatments. \n   Seldon patented a media for a lightweight, low-pressure water purifier that used carbon nanotubes to remove microorganisms from large quantities of water quickly; the production process fused the nanotubes into a membrane. After 2 years of testing, in-house data indicated that the Seldon filters reliably removed waterborne viruses and bacteria. Each cylindrical filter cleaned water successfully for 40-60 days, surpassing the NASA requirements for 30-day missions.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n              Comparable in size to a zucchini and operated like a straw, Seldon’s WaterStick cleans water by using nanotechnology to remove sediment, chemicals, bacteria, viruses, and microorganisms.\n    \n  \n  Phase II of the SBIR agreement included treating higher volumes of water with larger membranes; carbon nanotubes were connected into a mesh. Engineers studied filter regeneration and bio-film abatement techniques for extending filter life, and subjected the filter elements to chemical removal testing. Although Seldon designed the membranes for bio-removal (including viruses and bacteria), the filters also removed some contaminants and chemicals—Seldon scientists affirm specific chemical adsorption can be engineered into the nanotubes for future projects. \n  Testing in U.S. Environmental Protection Agency-certified facilities showed that Seldon’s Nanomesh removed microorganisms such as bacteria (99.9999 percent, or 6 log), viruses (99.99 percent, or 4 log), Cryptosporidium parvum, Giardia lamblia, and chemical contaminants including arsenic, lead, benzene, copper, dioxins, herbicides, mercury, and endotoxins, such as Escherichia coli (E.coli) and Salmonella. \n  Seldon designed, constructed, and tested prototypes of the final Nanomesh filter, before delivering them to NASA in November 2006. Seldon’s filters have potential applications in industrial water purification systems, industrial decontamination, and commercial and household use. \n  Product Outcome\n  The commercial version of the carbon Nanomesh designed under the NASA SBIR agreement was released as the WaterStick. Operating as simply as a straw and almost as small, the WaterStick cleans about 5 gallons (200 milliliters) of water per minute simply using water pressure (up to 3 PSI) and gravity: without electricity, heat, environmental impact, or chemical additives (such as iodine or chlorine used by other filters).\n  The lightweight filters measure about 10½ inches by 2 inches (27 cm by 5 cm), or similar in size to a zucchini. The WaterStick also removes chlorine and iodine, thereby creating water that is not only potable, but palatable as well. Lastly, the WaterStick is easy to use, requiring only a simple filter change every 7 weeks (for one person) or 73 gallons (275 liters.) The manufacturer considers the WaterStick to be “perfect for short-duration uses where other solutions are impractical.” \n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n                Recently used in Rwanda, Seldon’s WaterBox is the size of a small suitcase and is capable of supporting the water needs of a small village. \n    \n  \n  The ease and portability of the WaterStick makes it useful for a variety of applications in which access to clean water and electricity are restricted, such as remote locations or disaster areas. The Seldon WaterStick weighs only 8 ounces and is sold as a standalone device through which water can be poured. Seldon is currently targeting the lightweight WaterStick to disaster relief workers, researchers, and military personnel in remote locations with no wastewater facilities; future markets may include recreational hikers.\n   In locations where waterborne illness can prove disastrous, clean water is even more essential. The water filtration element achieves a high level of bacteria and virus removal while maintaining high flow rates and low pressure drops across the filter’s surface. According to Seldon CEO Alan Cummings, “Seldon products containing Nanomesh can provide mobile, life-saving ground and surface water filtration in field and disaster relief environments by removal of microorganisms that cause waterborne diseases.” \n  Most of the other commercial water filters do not offer the same level of filtration as the WaterStick; those employing a charcoal or ceramic filter are often less effective against viruses, and those offering comparable protection employ chemicals. Alternately, products that offer a high level of filtration may use ultraviolet light and thereby require batteries or electricity. Ultraviolet water treatment works well, but tends to be less effective in highly contaminated water with a high percentage of particulates. Seldon engineer Jonathan Winter states, “Our technology is superior, because it doesn’t need a certain amount of time or electricity.”\n  Seldon plans to develop an under-the-sink water filtration unit for residential use; like the WaterStick, these larger units would use water pressure to push water through the Nanomesh, and would not require electricity.

NASA employs cryogenics, the science of generating extremely low temperatures and the behavior of materials at those temperatures, in a variety of fluid management and low-temperature applications including vehicle propulsion, high-pressure gas supply, life support equipment, food preservation and packaging, pharmaceutical manufacturing, and imaging devices. Most prominently, cryogenic liquid hydrogen fuel is used by the space shuttle as its primary means of achieving orbit.\n  Looking to the future, NASA’s Constellation Program, which is focused on developing next-generation launch vehicles for planned trips to the Moon, Mars, and beyond, is incorporating cryogenics into the upper stage of the Ares I crew launch vehicle, the core stage and Earth departure stage of the Ares V cargo launch vehicle, and other systems. In support of this work, NASA’s Cryogenic Fluid Management (CFM) Project is performing experimental and analytical evaluation of several types of propellant management systems to enable safe and cost-effective exploration missions. The CFM Project is led by Glenn Research Center, with support from Marshall Space Flight Center, Johnson Space Center, Ames Research Center, Kennedy Space Center, and Goddard Space Flight Center. \n  Cryogenic propellants have been favored for their high-energy, high-efficiency performance; however, cryogenic propellants have not been used in extended-duration space missions since they are difficult to maintain in their highly dense liquid form at the low temperatures common in space and on the Moon. Performance requirements for the Earth departure stage, as well as the lunar lander descent and ascent stages, point toward the use of cryogenic engines and propellants for missions of up to 210 days on the surface of the Moon.\n  CFM team research is focused on the storage, fluid distribution, liquid acquisition, and mass gauging of cold propellants. These tasks will reduce the development risk and increase the ability of advanced subsystems to store and distribute cryogenic propellants required for long-term exploration missions. CFM utilizes the development of prototype CFM hardware, the creation and use of analytical models to predict subsystem performance, and the execution of ground-based tests using liquid oxygen, liquid hydrogen, and methane to demonstrate the performance, applicability, and reliability of CFM subsystems. \n  Partnership\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      A 4-inch valve undergoing cryogenic testing in a tank as part of the SBIR work with Marshall Space Flight Center. \n    \n  \n  Big Horn Valve Inc. (BHVI), of Sheridan, Wyoming, won a series of Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) contracts to explore and develop a revolutionary valve technology based on cryogenically proven Venturi Off-Set Technology (VOST). In 2001, BHVI first worked with Kennedy on an SBIR contract, “New and Innovative Valving Technology for Cryogenic Applications.” In 2003, BHVI’s proposal, “Low-Mass VOST Valve,” was selected from a field of 2,696 other entries nationwide to receive a Phase I SBIR contract, sponsored by Marshall under the Next Generation Launch Technology Program. This project developed a low-mass, high-efficiency, leak-proof cryogenic valve using composites and exotic metals, and had no stem-actuator, few moving parts, with an overall cylindrical shape. The valve geometry reduces launch vehicle complexity and facilitates assembly and testing. This valve also enhances reliability and safety, due to the inherent simplicity and leak-proof characteristic of the design. \n  According to principal investigator Zachary Gray, the work with NASA helped BHVI gain “ . . . a lot of experience with extreme environments. We gained a lot of contacts in the aerospace and cryogenic community. By attempting to solve NASA’s unique problems, we have greatly simplified the valve design while at the same time demonstrating that VOST worked well from half-inch diameters up to a 4-inch diameter.”\n  In 2005 and 2006, BHVI continued this work upon receipt of a Phase II SBIR award for “Low-Mass VOST Valve” from Marshall, and two Phase II SBIR awards from Johnson. These projects, “In-Space Cryogenic VOST Connect/Disconnect,” and “VOST Flow-Control Valve,” demonstrated that VOST cryogenic flow control offered precise linear flow control across the entire dynamic range, held its position without power, and required low actuation energy. This project paved the way for VOST valve application in future spaceport systems, advanced cryocoolers, launch vehicles, and high-pressure flow-control valves.\n  Product Outcome\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      BHVI enlisted the help of Moog Inc. to develop a pneumatically operated control valve. This photo shows a 4-inch valve undergoing cryogenic testing.\n    \n  \n  The precise control, inherent simplicity and durability, and demonstrated abilities of the VOST system afford many commercial applications, including petroleum refining, specialty chemical and high-purity pharmaceutical production, and the manufacture of industrial flow-control valves and food processing equipment. The VOST design is a magnetically actuated system in which internal magnets are used to close, open, and throttle the valve. This innovative stemless design, the only one commercially available, is emission-free with no external leakage of vapors or fluid and allows for superior fluid handling features (such as throttling, low-pressure drop, and axial envelope) within a single device structure. The VOST system has potential application in all valving environments and represents a new concept for a tradition-bound industry. \n  In December 2003, BHVI was selected to exhibit the VOST technology at the 2004 World’s Best Technologies Showcase, in Dallas, Texas. The 75 exhibitors selected came from the Nation’s most advanced research facilities, top universities, and entrepreneurs. The technologies displayed are considered the best of the best.\n  The first commercial MagVOST was installed March 16, 2006, at Windsor Energy Inc.’s methane coal gas field, east of Kaycee, Wyoming. Future applications are expected to include in-flight refueling of military aircraft and high-volume gas delivery systems such as liquefied natural gas (LNG). Big Horn is also exploring opportunities that require extreme attention to safety, such as with hydrofluoric acid in the petroleum refining industry and in the nuclear industry, and received an SBIR contract from the U.S. Navy to develop a bi-directional VOST valve for use as an isolation valve on ships.\n  VOST™ and MagVOST™ are trademarks of Big Horn Valve Inc.\n    \n    \n    \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n      \n\n\n\n\n"},{"href":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/er_6.html","text":"Web-Based Mapping Puts the World at Your Fingertips ","image":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/images/HOF-Medal_opt.jpeg","story":"\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n    \n    Environmental and Agricultural Resources\n  \n\n\n  Originating Technology/NASA Contribution \n  \n    \n    \n      \n      This image was constructed for a wetland mitigation study utilizing aerial imagery and soils and elevation data.\n    \n  \n  NASA’s award-winning Earth Resources Laboratory Applications Software (ELAS) package was developed at Stennis Space Center. Since 1978, ELAS has been used worldwide for processing satellite and airborne sensor imagery data of the Earth’s surface into readable and usable information. In addition to satellite applications such as data from Earth-observing SPOT (Satellites Pour l’Observation de la Terre) satellites, ELAS was applied to aircraft data and medical imagery. While the ensuing decades have seen great improvements in software and imaging technologies, the original developers of ELAS had the foresight to use a modular design, allowing capabilities to be added and expanded as the remote-sensing industry grew. \n  “ELAS provided a dictionary of parameters used consistently in over 100 applications, which aided users greatly. In addition, ELAS modules typically used a common set of basic commands; after a short introduction, the only difficulties with using ELAS were discovering what the various modules could do,” reflected Dr. Ray Seyfarth, one of the original developers of ELAS.\n  ELAS could be considered an “All-Star” NASA-derived technology, having made frequent appearances in Spinoff in myriad applications, including use by NASA’s Technology Application Center in studies of the urban growth in the Nile River Delta (Spinoff 1985); Delta Data Systems in the construction of their proprietary ATLAS geographic information system (Spinoff 1986) and Advanced Geographic Information System (Spinoff 1993); Ducks Unlimited Inc., in the construction of its Habitat Inventory and Evaluation Program (Spinoff 1987); Medical Image Management Systems in its diagnostic aid and image storage and distribution MD Image System (Spinoff 1991); Martin Marietta and the Mid-Atlantic Remote Sensing Center in the development of the Integrated Automated Emergency Management Information System earthquake preparedness program (Spinoff 1991); and DATASTAR Inc., in the DATASTAR Image Processing Exploitation (DIPEx) desktop and Internet image processing, analysis, and manipulation software (Spinoff 2003), the development of which has now been continued in DIPEx Version III. \n  Partnership\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      The Florida peninsula citrus growing region, as imaged by Landsat.\n    \n  \n  In 1992, Stennis’ Commercial Technology Program made ELAS available under the Freedom of Information Act, which allows federally developed technologies that are not patent protected to be transferred to U.S. companies. In DIPEx Version III, DATASTAR Inc., of Picayune, Mississippi, has once again used ELAS software to bring a tool to the public that captures and expands the abilities of ELAS. Improvements in the quality of satellite data have demanded corresponding development of processors, and DATASTAR leveraged the original ELAS design to address today’s local and regional database requirements. \n  Product Outcome\n  DIPEx is now a mature, user-friendly application used to perform image processing, analysis, and to manipulate remotely sensed imagery data. DIPEx can separate and provide data classifications, false color composites, soils, corridor analysis, subsurface vegetation, data enrichment, mosaics, and geographical information systems (GIS). The architecture of DIPEx allows a wide range of scalability, and the dynamic dimensionality of DIPEx internals assures that the software is current with leading-edge computer hardware. \n  Users request either a deliverable product from DATASTAR or access data sets via their own computers. Web customers subscribe to a selection of data points, then log on and manipulate the data on a secure server which DATASTAR provides to protect the personal data of subscribers. The system is structured to allow hundreds of users to access and extract layers of information simultaneously.\n  These layers are composed of the combination of a data source and a rendering asset, and are stored under a map view; any number of folders can be used to organize layer information. Map view assets allow a user to specify and save information, including legend, scalebar, geography, output format, and the layers to be rendered. Map views also provide an easy mechanism to share maps over the Web among groups of users. By decoupling the data source and the renderer, the storage and management of the data source are completely separate from the rendering, so a user can use one data source in many layers with different renderings. \n  The Web interface itself is a significant upgrade for DIPEx Version III. The original interface was composed of HTML pages on which the user posted form information. This architecture was effective, but did not lend itself to reusability and was quickly approaching its limits. Version III is completely implemented using SOAP Web Services. The Web Services have also proved very useful for other applications, and DATASTAR currently has Microsoft .Net connection software and Perl applications exploiting functionality of the DIPEx server.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Combination of imagery, point, line, and polygon data.\n    \n  \n  A true World Wide Web application that runs using hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) and starts without a Web browser, Version III evolved with worldwide geospatial dimensionality and numerous other improvements. Version III is difficult to distinguish from a Windows-based application, with all the familiar menu systems, mouse interaction, and drag and drop interfaces. DATASTAR is enhancing the system’s mapping capabilities and colorizing data to give it depth. Data provided by DIPEx is compatible with all GIS software packages, including ArcView, ENVI, and ERDAS IMAGINE. \n  The flexibility and adaptability of the DIPEx system continues a defining trait that has held since the original ELAS was developed. Taking complicated sets of data and integrating them into a clear and useful product has long been the purpose of this software, and Seyfarth enjoys how far the software he helped create has come, affirming, “I am happy to hear that ELAS is alive in the software of DATASTAR. The work from 30 years ago is still valuable; I suspect there is a hold-out somewhere who is still typing ELAS commands.”\n  Dr. Ramona Pelletier Travis, who worked with ELAS as a research scientist in the 1980s and is now the manager of the Innovative Partnerships Program at Stennis, concludes: “ELAS was a fantastic tool then, and I’m glad that its various progeny have seen so much success, including DIPEx.

The satellite carries several instruments and is part of the Science Mission Directorate’s study of deep space. The RXTE measures the timescale of flickering X-rays, called oscillations, revealing the underlying physics of the violent environment around objects such as neutron stars and black holes. The oscillations reveal the nature of the physical environment of the star system, so by studying these oscillations and tracking the same X-ray sources for years, RXTE scientists form a picture of the events that are taking place.\n    One of the enabling technologies created for the RXTE mission was the Advanced System for Integration and Spacecraft Test (ASIST) software, a real-time command and control system for spacecraft development, integration, and operations. It was designed to be fully functional across a broad spectrum of satellites and instrumentation, while also being user friendly.\n    Partnership\n    Annapolis, Maryland-based designAmerica Inc. (DAI), a small aerospace company specializing in the development and delivery of ground control systems for satellites and instrumentation, was one of the organizations that assisted Goddard in the development of the ASIST software. \n    Realizing that the technology had broader applications in the commercial sector, designAmerica sought assistance from the Innovative Partnerships Program at Goddard, which assisted the company in licensing the software for commercial applications. The company is now marketing ASIST as a commercial-off-the-shelf solution in an arena once restricted to costly, custom-developed, project-specific software. \n    Product Outcome\n    \n      \n      \n        \n      \n      \n                    The Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) is a NASA-supported astrophysics mission that was launched on June 24, 1999, to explore the universe using the technique of high-resolution spectroscopy in the far-ultraviolet spectral region. Maryland-based designAmerica Inc. provided software to aid this mission. \n      \n    \n    ASIST is now a highly complex computer application designed to both meet the demanding technical requirements of modern satellites and their instrumentation and to serve as a tool for the engineers who construct and sustain the technology. The commercial version boasts the same level of functionality as the NASA-developed one, plus adds an approachable user interface, making it an effective and easy solution for customers to implement. \n    DAI’s commercialized version of the ASIST technology is working its way back to the Space Program. The technology was selected by Lockheed Martin Corporation as the in-house integration and test and mission operations system at its satellite production facility in Denver for the Origins Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification and Security (OSIRIS) mission, which is scheduled to launch in 2011 to survey an asteroid and provide the first return of asteroid surface material samples to Earth, and for the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) mission. The demonstrated cost savings is well over $3 million for the ground system element.\n    Northrop Grumman Corporation is also using designAmerica’s NASA-developed technology as its basic rapid-development component for in-house project flight software development and avionics integration and test labs. This work benefits a range of satellites that the company is developing in-house, including for NASA missions such as the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS).

The Polymers Branch falls under this division, and it is involved in the development of high-performance materials, including polymers for high-temperature polymer matrix composites; nanocomposites for both high- and low-temperature applications; durable aerogels; purification and functionalization of carbon nanotubes and their use in composites; computational modeling of materials and biological systems and processes; and developing polymer-derived molecular sensors. Essentially, this branch creates high-performance materials to reduce the weight and boost performance of components for space missions and aircraft engine components.\n  Under the leadership of chemical engineer, Dr. Michael Meador, the Polymers Branch boasts world-class laboratories, composite manufacturing facilities, testing stations, and some of the best scientists in the field. \n  Partnership \n  The Polymers Branch’s extensive knowledge of polyimide chemistry and its expertise in the synthesis of ultraviolet-light-curable polyimides was the critical component that allowed Advanced Coatings International (ACI), of Akron, Ohio, to prototype the platform chemistry for a polyimide-based, waterborne, liquid photoimagable coating ideal for the manufacture of printed circuit boards.\n  Glenn and its partners in the Glenn Alliance for Technology Exchange (GATE), the Ohio Aerospace Institute (OAI), and Battelle’s Great Lakes Industrial Technology Center (GLITeC) selected ACI as one of the winners of the GATE Partnership Award Program, a competition that targets small Ohio companies interested in enhancing their products and processes with NASA technologies.\n  ACI was one of 4 companies selected out of 38 applicants and received $50,000 to use toward product development, plus was eligible for an additional $50,000 to spend toward NASA assistance in developing their product. The company chose the additional NASA assistance, and Glenn set the company up with Meador to use his laboratories and polyimide chemistry expertise to develop the advanced water-based coating.\n  Product Outcome\n  \n    \n    \n      \n      \n        Devoted to developing advanced, high-temperature materials and processes, Glenn Research Center’s Structures and Materials Division works to create enabling technologies for future aerospace propulsion and power generation systems, such as the J-2X engine, planned to power the new crew launch vehicle’s upper stage and the Earth-departure stage of the cargo launch vehicle.\n    \n  \n  Electronics manufacturers, constantly seeking ways to make their products smaller, lighter, and less expensive to produce, use advanced materials to meet ever-changing, demanding performance requirements. Often, they use polyimides as a substrate on which to form flexible circuit boards and create rigid/flexible hybrid circuits. The final step of this manufacturing process is to coat the circuit in an encapsulating, protective barrier, called a soldermask, usually a solvent-borne coating. These solvents tend to release harmful, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) into the atmosphere, both an environmental concern, and a safety hazard for employees exposed to the toxic fumes. \n  With Meador’s assistance, ACI developed an advanced water-based coating that can be used in the manufacture of printed circuit boards in place of a traditional solvent-based formula. These water-based polyimide coatings are environmentally friendly and offer an improved level of worker safety. In fact, clean up requires just soap and water. Since they offer a safe, effective alternative to traditional solvent-based methods of electronics manufacturing, they are the preferred alternative for the environmentally conscious manufacturer. \n  In addition to improved safety and reduced environmental impact, these coatings have the potential to reduce manufacturing and operating costs. After working with a customer to evaluate this method, ACI now estimates that this new technology has the potential to save manufacturers of these devices operating costs of up to 25 percent, a figure that is sure to attract attention. \n  Additionally, the technology improves resolution, enabling manufacturers to create the smaller physical features required by today’s electronics market. The environmentally friendly coating is photographically imaged onto the circuit board, providing a clear, precise, permanent protective layering. \n  Leveraging NASA expertise, ACI has managed to create an environmentally friendly, safe, and affordable process for manufacturing key components in a highly competitive, performance-driven market.\n    \n    \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n      \n\n\n"},{"href":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/ct_3.html","text":"Software Schedules Missions, Aids Project Management ","image":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/images/ct-3.gif","story":"\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n  Computer Technology\n  \n\n\n  Originating Technology/NASA Contribution\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n                Knowledge-Based Systems Inc.’s AIOXFinder is an ideal search engine for sharing information in multisystem computer application environments. \n    \n  \n  NASA missions require advanced planning, scheduling, and management, and the Space Agency has worked extensively to develop the programs and software suites necessary to facilitate these complex missions. These enormously intricate undertakings have hundreds of active components that need constant management and monitoring. It is no surprise, then, that the software developed for these tasks is often applicable in other high-stress, complex environments, like in government or industrial settings. \n  NASA work over the past few years has resulted in a handful of new scheduling, knowledge-management, and research tools developed under contract with one of NASA’s partners. These tools have the unique responsibility of supporting NASA missions, but they are also finding uses outside of the Space Program. \n  Partnership\n  Knowledge-Based Systems Inc. (KBSI), of College Station, Texas, has worked with NASA on a handful of long-term Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contracts, which have ultimately allowed the company to develop several advanced technology solutions. \n  The first NASA SBIR contract was entered into with Johnson Space Center to create the Knowledge Aided Mission Planning System, or KAMPS, software for modeling and analyzing mission planning activities, simulating behavior and, using a unique constraint propagation mechanism, updating plans with each change in mission planning activities.\n  This successful NASA project led to another SBIR contract, this time with Kennedy Space Center, through which KBSI created another software solution, this one named the Optimization Modeling Assistant, or OMA, a set of tools to enable project managers to formulate optimization models—intelligent decisions made using a ranked system of prioritized choices. The various decision-making programs developed by KBSI under these research projects with NASA have spun off into U.S. Air Force applications, have entered the commercial sector under the name of WorkSim, and have also been reintegrated into NASA programs where they have been used to model shuttle flows. \n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n                Through partnering with NASA, Knowledge-Based Systems Inc. developed several advanced technology solutions that are aiding space missions and industry.\n    \n  \n  A third SBIR, again with Kennedy, resulted in the development of yet another software, this one a Web-based product, called the Portfolio Analysis Tool, or PAT, which allows teams of managers on the same project to make strategic investment decisions. This tool is currently in use by NASA, the U.S. Air Force, and the U.S. Army. \n  Yet another SBIR with Kennedy allowed KBSI to create the Range Process Simulation Tool (RPST), which is now in use by the U.S. Army Black Hawk Fleet for operational performance. \n  The company also created the Toolkit for Enabling Adaptive Modeling and Simulation (TEAMS), through another Kennedy SBIR, which later, through a Phase III contract, evolved into the TEAMS+, a real-time operational analysis software that helps develop, maintain, and reconfigure operations analysis models and is the most recent commercialized product to have come out of KBSI’s long history of NASA involvement, which includes years of working on NASA contracts since the company’s founding in 1988. \n  United Space Alliance, one of the world’s leading space operations companies, based near Johnson Space Center in Houston, is now using TEAMS for space shuttle ground processing to support operations analysis, planning, and scheduling. The program provides operations modeling and analysis for space transportation systems. According to Dr. Perakath Benjamin, KBSI vice president, the SBIR program has helped the company build and deploy advanced technology solutions that are benefiting NASA, the U.S. Department of Defense, and private industry. \n  Product Outcome\n  Three specific commercial products that KBSI developed trace their roots directly back to the work with NASA: WorkSim, Model Mosaic, and AIOXFinder.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n                The company has been able to apply the work it has done with NASA to several U.S. Air Force projects.\n    \n  \n  WorkSim is a resource-constrained daily work-dispatching tool that generates optimized, daily schedules. It helps agencies streamline and speed their planning and scheduling and assists in the routine management of workflow and personnel, and its schedules can be generated in either Microsoft Excel or Project. \n  Model Mosaic is a knowledge-management work kit, much of which was developed through foundational work at Johnson Space Center. This software, while still under development, is based on the IDEF5 ontology description capture method that was developed by KBSI and is a government standard for object-oriented modeling. It allows users to extract the essential nature of concepts in the ontology domain and to document, in a structured manner, the behavior of entity relations in terms of the sanctioned inferences that can be made with them. The Model Mosaic toolkit includes an ontology management component that allows users to archive and, over time, to develop collections of ontologies that can be selectively analyzed, compared, pruned, and combined for use in novel systems development efforts. The Model Mosaic software also provides import and export capability to other popular ontology modeling languages like OWL and UML, and is plug-compatible with other OWL-based ontology editors.\n  AIOXFinder is an ontology-driven integration framework (ODIF), a type of search engine that is ideal for knowledge sharing and communication in large military enterprises or in multisystem computer application environments. The software refines a user’s search according to that user’s profile, or ontology, making it easier for researchers to weed out non-applicable hits in databases or through Internet searching.

It was developed to meet many of the Agency’s demanding and rigorous artificial intelligence goals for current and future needs. \n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n                Two sulfurous eruptions are visible on Jupiter’s volcanic moon Io in this color composite image from the robotic Galileo spacecraft that orbited Jupiter from 1995 to 2003. SHINE significantly decreased the operations cost for this mission, while increasing both reliability and safety.\n    \n  \n  NASA developed the sophisticated and reusable software based on the experience and requirements of its Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s (JPL) Artificial Intelligence Research Group in developing expert systems for space flight operations—specifically, the diagnosis of spacecraft health. It was designed to be efficient enough to operate in demanding real time and in limited hardware environments, and to be utilized by non-expert systems applications written in conventional programming languages. \n  The technology is currently used in several ongoing NASA applications, including the Mars Exploration Rovers and the Spacecraft Health Automatic Reasoning Pilot (SHARP) program for the diagnosis of telecommunication anomalies during the Neptune Voyager Encounter. It is also finding applications outside of the Space Agency. \n  Partnership\n  VIASPACE Inc., of Pasadena, California, a company dedicated to the commercialization of NASA and U.S. Department of Defense technologies, licensed the JPL-developed SHINE software from Caltech, which operates the laboratory for NASA. The company has an exclusive, worldwide license from Caltech to commercialize SHINE technology for most major applications, including industrial, diagnostics/prognostics, sensor fusion, and homeland defense.\n  In January 2007, the company was awarded a prestigious NASA Space Act Award, which is given for significant scientific and technical contribution and provides recognition for those inventions and other scientific and technical contributions that have helped to achieve the Agency’s aeronautical, technology transfer, and space goals.\n  Debbie Wolfenbarger, at JPL’s Innovative Partnerships Program office, says of the partnership, “It is exciting to see a technology with such a rich history of being utilized in NASA missions make the leap to the commercial sector. Its potential in commercial applications such as diagnostics/prognostics and homeland defense applications will directly benefit the public and is an excellent demonstration of the positive effects resulting from licensing NASA technology.”\n  Product Outcome\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n                SHINE has been applied to many NASA missions, including the Mars Exploration Rovers program.\n    \n  \n  SHINE has been successfully applied to over a dozen applications both throughout NASA and within the commercial sector. It has significantly impacted operations cost, reliability, and safety in eight NASA deep space missions that include Voyager, Galileo, Magellan, and the Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer (EUVE). \n  SHINE has been used in the NASA Deep Space Network for diagnosing anomalies. It operates in a real-time environment, interfacing with in excess of 40 different legacy systems generating decisions and recommendations for control of the telecommunication systems. It has been employed by Ames Research Center as part of the Exploration Technology Development Program for onboard monitoring of flight system hardware and software with recovery. Johnson Space Center’s Space Operations Management Office has used the software for technology transfer and experiments on robotics for crewed space flight. Marshall Space Flight Center has used SHINE to conduct tests and evaluation experiments to support fault monitoring and abort system design for the Ares I.\n  JPL has also used the software both on its Engineering Analysis Subsystem Environment program, to operate a large number of spacecraft simultaneously through shared resources and automation, and in its EUVE, a NASA explorer-class satellite mission which employed SHINE to accomplish a labor reduction system, from three to one shift reductions through the use of artificial intelligence. On the Galileo mission, en route to Jupiter and its moons, NASA used SHINE for diagnosing problems in the Power and Pyro Subsystem. The Magellan mission, en route to Venus, benefited from SHINE’s diagnosis of several telecommunication anomalies in the telecom subsystem.\n  As part of the Spacecraft Health Automatic Reasoning Pilot program, SHINE provided diagnosis of telecommunication anomalies during the Neptune Voyager encounter. This application prevented the possible loss of the entire mission for detecting a failing transponder long before it was possible for a human to notice and just 12 hours prior to the encounter. \n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      The Mars Exploration Rover mission is part of NASA’s Mars Exploration Program, a long-term effort of robotic exploration of the Red Planet.\n    \n  \n  As part of JPL’s X-33 Avionics Flight Experiment, SHINE was used as a Vehicle Health Manager.\n  It has also been used for several non-NASA aeronautics projects, including Lockheed Martin’s Joint Strike Fighter, which involved proprietary efforts using SHINE in conjunction with the JPL-developed Beacon-based Exception Analysis for Multimissions (BEAM) software for fault diagnosis. SHINE was also successfully applied to anomaly detection on the F-18 aircraft. It was delivered as part of the BEAM anomaly detection system and ran on flight hardware, where it performed real-time mode identification on two F-18 aircraft engines and was tested in the F-18 hardware-in-loop (Iron Bird) simulator and during actual flight tests. \n  The U.S. Navy has employed SHINE as part of its Naval Sea Systems Command Integrated Vehicle Health Management program, for its capability to rapidly determine combat readiness in crisis situations and prognostics of network health coupled with remediation.\n  In addition, it has been applied to medical applications for Welch Allyn Inc., Johnson & Johnson, ViaLogy LLC, and VIASPACE. The company has also added new software capabilities that significantly enhance the functionality, flexibility, and ease of use of the SHINE system. The VIASPACE Knowledge Base Editor enables users to accelerate the development of SHINE-based applications and demonstrate capabilities and features for potential new markets and applications.\n    \n    \n    \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n      \n  \n\n"},{"href":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/ct_5.html","text":"Wireless Sensor Network Handles Image Data ","image":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/images/ct-9.jpeg","story":"\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n  Computer Technology\n  \n\n\n  Originating Technology/NASA Contribution\n  To relay data from remote locations for NASA’s Earth sciences research, Goddard Space Flight Center contributed to the development of “microservers” (wireless sensor network nodes), which are now used commercially as a quick and affordable means to capture and distribute geographical information, including rich sets of aerial and street-level imagery.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Firefighters could use the microserver technology to rapidly locate and track the spread of forest fires.\n          Photo-John McColgan BLM Alaska Fire Service.\n    \n  \n  NASA began this work out of a necessity for real-time recovery of remote sensor data. These microservers work much like a wireless office network, relaying information between devices. The key difference, however, is that instead of linking workstations within one office, the interconnected microservers operate miles away from one another. This attribute traces back to the technology’s original use: The microservers were originally designed for seismology on remote glaciers and ice streams in Alaska, Greenland, and Antarctica—acquiring, storing, and relaying data wirelessly between ground sensors. \n  The microservers boast three key attributes. First, a researcher in the field can establish a “managed network” of microservers and rapidly see the data streams (recovered wirelessly) on a field computer. This rapid feedback permits the researcher to reconfigure the network for different purposes over the course of a field campaign. Second, through careful power management, the microservers can dwell unsupervised in the field for up to 2 years, collecting tremendous amounts of data at a research location. The third attribute is the exciting potential to deploy a microserver network that works in synchrony with robotic explorers (e.g., providing ground truth validation for satellites, supporting rovers as they traverse the local environment). \n  Managed networks of remote microservers that relay data unsupervised for up to 2 years can drastically reduce the costs of field instrumentation and data recovery.\n  Partnership\n  NASA did not create these microservers alone. Vexcel Corporation, of Boulder, Colorado, received Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) funding through Goddard to develop the wireless sensor network technology that now aids in the high-speed handling of image data. This technology has uses in both the commercial sector, where it is used to relay satellite imagery to the desktop, and in the government sector, where NASA is finding continued use in terrestrial and interplanetary studies.\n  The STTR program is a three-phase program that reserves a specific percentage of Federal research and development funding for award to small businesses in partnership with nonprofit research institutions to move ideas from the laboratory to the marketplace, to foster high-tech economic development, and to address the technological needs of the Federal government. One of the few companies selected for this highly competitive program, Vexcel, a recognized world leader in the fields of photogrammetry, imagery, and remote sensing technologies, worked in partnership with Goddard and Pennsylvania State University to develop the new sensor network technology. \n  The work commenced in 2002, with an initial Phase I STTR award, the start-up phase for exploration of the scientific, technical, and commercial feasibility of the technology. The work proved promising, and the company continued with a Phase II award in 2004. This second phase expands the work done under the first agreement, signals the initiation of the research and development phase, and is when the developer begins to consider commercialization potential. Vexcel excelled again in this phase and moved on to the highly prized Phase III, in which the company was able to bring the technology to market. \n  Soon after completing this long development process, Vexcel’s new technology caught the eye of the Microsoft Corporation, which acquired the company in spring of 2006. \n  Vexcel’s expertise in imaging technologies is now being applied to Microsoft’s Virtual Earth business unit, incorporating the NASA-derived technology into its Microsoft Live Search, Virtual Earth service. \n  Product Outcome\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      On May 23, 2006, Jeff Williams, flight engineer of International Space Station Expedition 13, photographed this plume of ash produced by Cleveland Volcano, one of the most active of the volcanoes in the Aleutian Islands. The microserver technology could be used to divert air traffic from flying into plumes like this one, which spread as high as 6,000 meters (20,000 feet) above sea level. \n    \n  \n  Microsoft’s goal in using the technology is to bring real-time imagery and other types of searchable data to the desktop. Using Vexcel’s microserver technology, Microsoft hopes to add real-time information to its Live Search geographic search engine with many “information telepresence” applications. For example, firefighters could rapidly locate and track the spread of forest fires, and air traffic controllers could divert trans-Pacific flights away from ash plumes emanating from erupting Aleutian volcanoes.\n  Microsoft will use the microservers to gather real-time geospatial data (i.e., information connected to specific geographical locations) in order to provide users not only text data and maps from searches but also imagery including a bird’s-eye view and three-dimensional pictures.\n  In addition to further internal development supported by Microsoft, the technology continues to be developed by Vexcel researchers under funding from NASA’s Earth Science Technology Office’s Advanced Information Systems Technology program. Working under the acronym SEAMONSTER (South East Alaska Monitoring Network for Science, Telecommunications, Education, and Research), the project supports collaborative environmental science with near-real-time recovery of large volumes of environmental data. The initial geographic focus is at Alaska’s Lemon Glacier and Lemon Creek watershed near Juneau, where the technology is being used to relay data about the glacier’s effect on the hydrochemistry of Lemon Creek. Future expansion is planned in the Juneau Icefield and the coastal marine environment of the Alexander Archipelago.\n  This innovative sensor network technology may play a significant role in global climate research, as well as many other Earth science-related monitoring projects. In addition to these applications, Vexcel researchers are designing SEAMONSTER to be a powerful learning and teaching tool both through its construction and in planning for its future operation.\n  Microsoft® is a registered trademark, and Virtual Earth™ is a trademark of Microsoft Corporation.\n    \n    \n    \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n      \n\n\n"},{"href":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/ct_6.html","text":"Virtual Reality System Offers a Wide Perspective ","image":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/images/ct-11.jpeg","story":"\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n  Computer Technology\n  \n\n\n  Originating Technology/NASA Contribution\n  Robot Systems Technology Branch engineers at Johnson Space Center created the remotely controlled Robonaut for use as an additional “set of hands” in extravehicular activities (EVAs) and to allow exploration of environments that would be too dangerous or difficult for humans. One of the problems Robonaut developers encountered was that the robot’s interface offered an extremely limited field of vision. Johnson robotics engineer, Darby Magruder, explained that the 40-degree field-of-view (FOV) in initial robotic prototypes provided very narrow tunnel vision, which posed difficulties for Robonaut operators trying to see the robot’s surroundings. Because of the narrow FOV, NASA decided to reach out to the private sector for assistance. In addition to a wider FOV, NASA also desired higher resolution in a head-mounted display (HMD) with the added ability to capture and display video.\n  Partnership\n  \n    \n    \n      \n      An operator in the background wears a head-mounted display that allows him to see through the Robonaut’s eyes (cameras) with a wide near-human field-of-view.\n    \n  \n  Founded by former Johns Hopkins University optics researcher, Dr. Lawrence Brown, Sensics Inc., received a NASA Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program award in 2003, and began Phase I of their FOV interface for NASA’s Robonaut, which also included development of a wide FOV camera. Baltimore-based Sensics created an HMD with a wide FOV, using a patented optical design to combine several tiled images into a high-resolution, three-dimensional panorama. A follow-on Phase II SBIR project culminated with Sensics delivering the piSight HMD to Johnson Space Center in February 2008, after delivering the prototype the year before. \n  The Sensics piSight HMD, essentially a high-tech viewfinder, offers an additional panoramic, high-resolution camera array that allows remote control and telepresence, immersing the HMD operator in the robot’s workspace in real time. The operator sees through Robonaut’s “eyes” and controls its movements, working safely from a distance. “Astronauts wearing a piSight will feel just like they are experiencing the world from Robonaut’s perspective, due to the full field-of-view, which is an exciting advance for the NASA robotics program,” says Brown. \n  Product Outcome\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      The lightweight piSight head-mounted display offers a wide field-of-view with multiple screens per eye to allow for more realistic visual experiences.\n    \n  \n  With the piSight, virtual surroundings appear in the viewfinder and respond to head movements. By coordinating head and joystick movements, the user flies or coasts up, down, forward, or sideways. Some versions of the piSight work with motion trackers, which eliminate the need for a joystick and, instead, follow the user’s movement realistically. \n  When used with the piSight, InterSense Inc.’s SoniWing tracks user movements, employing technology similar to some video gaming systems. With the addition of the SoniWing, the user’s entire body moves within the virtual environment, allowing greater freedom than systems restricted to head motion, and the environment responds realistically to the user’s location and movements. Sensics also offers customized systems that track a user’s eye movements, which help vision researchers learn which images or objects in a scene hold a user’s interest, and also offers a video see-through solution for applications in which users need to see the virtual world and reality simultaneously.\n  The piSight HMD is light (weighing less than 2 pounds), stable, comfortable, and adjustable to an individual’s head and eye shape, but Sensics still wants to make the technology more lightweight and efficient. Currently, piSight can be used with a variety of virtual reality software and platforms, including OpenSceneGraph on Linux and WorldViz products on Windows. \n  The piSight also offers high resolution “better than an HDTV display,” according to Brown, with the NASA model displaying 12 screens per eye; lower-end models have as few as 3 screens per eye. Other commercially available HMDs usually offer fewer screens, fewer cameras, or poorer resolution, which leads to either a much smaller field of vision (i.e., no peripheral vision) or a poor-quality image that appears pixilated or stretched. With more screens per eye, however, each display can offer a slightly different orientation, forming a concave arrangement that wraps around the eye, and projecting a different and more realistic perspective. In a higher-end model, the user can see in high resolution for 150 degrees, which is almost as wide as the natural range for humans. “The operator basically sees a field-of-view that has virtually no limitations,” Brown notes. \n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      The piSight can be used with Linux or Windows virtual reality software, and can be controlled via motion trackers \n        or joysticks.\n    \n  \n  The piSight camera array captures panoramic, high-resolution live video, which a user views while wearing the piSight HMD. Video is compressed, sent over a network, and then displayed inside the HMD. This interface may be able to support astronauts and engineers on Earth with various tasks like repairs and maintenance in high-risk environments. An astronaut in orbit, for example, could use the piSight remotely to control a robot on the surface of the Moon and examine the surrounding environment in real time. The system could also enhance safety on Earth by enabling remote operation of machinery in biohazard, defense, or medical environments, without requiring physical access to the site. In an emergency involving hazardous materials, a human operator could use the piSight system to remedy the situation from a safe location.\n  Sensics is finding success in the commercial sector, with sales of its products topping $1 million in 2007. Sensics is currently marketing the piSight to larger companies, since system prices start at about $27,500. Depending on customization and features, such as additional camera arrays for a wider field-of-vision, the units can cost up to $100,000.\n  Commercial applications for the piSight are only limited by customers’ imaginations. “Customers have been selecting the piSight systems for a variety of simulation, training, design, and research applications,” says Brown. An automobile designer uses the HMD to “sit” in the driver’s seat of an automobile and explore the design in a realistic, immersive experience before production begins. Other companies are beginning to use the piSight for training purposes that involve learning specific tasks in situations, such as teaching a quarterback a specific play or showing a soldier how to operate a certain piece of equipment.

As the devices that reproduce images become more and more sophisticated, so do the technologies that verify their accuracy. By simulating the manner in which a human eye perceives and interprets a visual stimulus, NASA scientists have found ways to automatically and accurately test new monitors and displays.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      The Spatial Standard Observer software measures visibility and defects in screens, displays, and interfaces.\n    \n  \n  The Spatial Standard Observer (SSO) software metric, developed by Dr. Andrew B. Watson at Ames Research Center, measures visibility and defects in screens, displays, and interfaces. In the design of such a software tool, a central challenge is determining which aspects of visual function to include—while accuracy and generality are important, relative simplicity of the software module is also a key virtue. Based on data collected in ModelFest, a large cooperative multi-lab project hosted by the Optical Society of America, the SSO simulates a simplified model of human spatial vision, operating on a pair of images that are viewed at a specific viewing distance with pixels having a known relation to luminance. \n  The SSO measures the visibility of foveal spatial patterns, or the discriminability of two patterns, by incorporating only a few essential components of vision. These components include local contrast transformation, a contrast sensitivity function, local masking, and local pooling. By this construction, the SSO provides output in units of “just noticeable differences” (JND)—a unit of measure based on the assumed smallest difference of sensory input detectable by a human being. Herein is the truly amazing ability of the SSO—while conventional methods can manipulate images, the SSO models human perception. This set of equations actually defines a mathematical way of working with an image that accurately reflects the way in which the human eye and mind behold a stimulus. \n  The SSO is intended for a wide variety of applications, such as evaluating vision from unmanned aerial vehicles, measuring visibility of damage to aircraft and to the space shuttles, predicting outcomes of corrective laser eye surgery, inspecting displays during the manufacturing process, estimating the quality of compressed digital video, evaluating legibility of text, and predicting discriminability of icons or symbols in a graphical user interface.\n  Partnership\n  Radiant Imaging Inc., of Duvall, Washington, develops systems and software for testing and measuring color and light for lighting and display system designers, developers, manufacturers, and other users. To make use of the SSO’s defect detection abilities in its work, the company licensed the software from Ames.\n  Already focused on the human perception of color and light in its line of colorimeters and photometers, Radiant Imaging sought this proven model as a means to design a system that reflected more perceptually meaningful criteria than gearing toward some scientific spectral characteristics. Ames provided training and consultation to the engineers at Radiant Imaging regarding the SSO and related theory. The SSO software was then used to develop the TrueMURA Analysis Module. The module was incorporated into Radiant Imaging’s proprietary ProMetric 9.1 system, originally created to provide automated defect detection analysis for flat panel display (FPD) systems. When used in conjunction with the ProMetric Series Imaging Colorimeters, the new software module provides a complete characterization and testing system for FPDs—especially LCD panels and displays—in research and development and production processes.\n  Automatic simulation of the human perception of display defects or blemishes—mura—is difficult, because human visual recognition of uniformity variations and other defects is dependent on many factors including brightness, color, and spatial relationships. Most available image analysis techniques are based on simple techniques which identify gross defects, but do not accurately discriminate JND. TrueMURA allows a grading of LCD mura in a way designed to mimic human observers, ignoring mura that cannot be seen by humans and ranking those likely to be distinguished by humans into different categories. TrueMURA is thus well-correlated to human perception of defects in brightness, color, and blemishes, and provides useful, quantifiable analysis of an FPD image. \n  Product Outcome\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      The Spatial Standard Observer is particularly useful for the inspection of displays during the manufacturing process.\n    \n  \n  Radiant Imaging released the TrueMURA Analysis Module for ProMetric 9.1 in December 2007. This is the first commercial system available to provide advanced image analysis algorithms for computing JND. Augmenting the defect analysis functions offered by ProMetric 9.1, the TrueMURA Analysis Module has already been successfully integrated into thousands of systems in use worldwide. \n  “Working with NASA afforded Radiant Imaging access to cutting edge technology and expertise, and technology transfer without commercial biases,” said Dr. Hubert Kostal, of Radiant Imaging. “Together with PM Series Imaging Colorimeters, TrueMURA provides an accurate, repeatable, and objective means of assessing LCD display image quality.” \n  The TrueMURA Analysis Module is now being integrated into Radiant Imaging’s ProMetric Production Test Sequencer, used by display manufacturers to automate production testing of FPDs and projectors. By further automating defect detection, TrueMURA is expected to increase the speed and reduce the cost of product testing. While the primary applications for TrueMURA will continue to be display image quality, other applications for measuring visual uniformity are under investigation and anticipated in the near future.\n  TrueMURA™ and PM Series™ are trademarks, and ProMetric® is a registered trademark of Radiant Imaging Inc. \n    \n    \n    \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n      \n  \n\n"},{"href":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/ct_8.html","text":"Inductive System Monitors Tasks ","image":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/images/ct-16.jpeg","story":"\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n  \n  Computer Technology\n  \n\n\n  Originating Technology/NASA Contribution\n  The Inductive Monitoring System (IMS) software developed at Ames Research Center uses artificial intelligence and data mining techniques to build system-monitoring knowledge bases from archived or simulated sensor data. This information is then used to detect unusual or anomalous behavior that may indicate an impending system failure. \n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      NASA partnered with industry to develop a new systems health monitoring software to increase safety and efficiency in complex industrial plants, such as power generation and water treatment facilities.\n    \n  \n  Currently helping analyze data from systems that help fly and maintain the space shuttle and the International Space Station (ISS), the IMS has also been employed by NASA’s hybrid combustion facility; an advanced rocket fuel test facility; the UH-60A RASCAL Black Hawk helicopter; and to monitor engine systems on an F/A-18 Hornet aircraft.\n  IMS uses techniques from the fields of model-based reasoning, machine learning, and data mining, though unlike some other machine learning techniques, IMS does not require examples of anomalous behavior, or failures, to learn. IMS automatically analyzes nominal system data to form general classes of expected system sensor values. This process enables the software to inductively learn and model nominal system behavior. The generated data classes are then used to build a monitoring knowledge base. \n  In real time, IMS performs monitoring functions: determining and displaying the degree of deviation from nominal performance. IMS trend analyses can detect conditions that may indicate a failure or required system maintenance.\n  The development of IMS was motivated by the difficulty of producing detailed diagnostic models of some system components due to complexity or unavailability of design information.\n  Successful applications have ranged from real-time monitoring of aircraft engine and control systems to anomaly detection in space shuttle and ISS data. IMS was used on shuttle missions STS-121, STS-115, and STS-116 to search the Wing Leading Edge Impact Detection System (WLEIDS) data for signs of possible damaging impacts during launch. It independently verified findings of the WLEIDS Mission Evaluation Room (MER) analysts and indicated additional points of interest that were subsequently investigated by the MER team.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Industries that monitor the health of their equipment and processes with either online or batch sampling can benefit from the use of Process Data Miner.\n    \n  \n  In support of the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate, IMS is being deployed as an anomaly detection tool on ISS mission control consoles in the Johnson Space Center Mission Operations Directorate. IMS has been trained to detect faults in the ISS Control Moment Gyroscope (CMG) systems. In laboratory tests, it has already detected several minor anomalies in real-time CMG data. When tested on archived data, IMS was able to detect precursors of the CMG1 failure nearly 15 hours in advance of the actual failure event.\n  In the Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate, IMS successfully performed real-time engine health analysis. IMS was able to detect simulated failures and actual engine anomalies in an F/A-18 aircraft during the course of 25 test flights. IMS is also being used in collaboration with the Federal Aviation Administration’s Aviation Safety Information Analysis and Sharing (ASIAS) system to analyze commercial airline data for anomalies that may indicate potential safety hazards.\n  Partnership\n  IMS can be used to monitor nearly any system with recurring behavior and appropriate data collection. This allows application to any number of system monitoring tasks. \n  iSagacity Inc., based out of Portland, Maine, executed a non-exclusive license with Ames for use of the IMS software. iSagacity was founded in 2001 as a provider of engineering software and consulting services to the process industries has a Web-based platform called Remote Manager, used for collecting data in real time, monitoring, and analyzing data for industrial process systems. Customer applications for the Remote Manager include water treatment plants, water heating and cooling in the process industry, oil refineries, public water distribution, and power generation plants.\n  In June 2006, iSagacity licensed IMS to complement the capabilities of its Remote Manager tool for monitoring industrial process systems. \n  The license is helping iSagacity to build early warning and diagnostics software systems for a variety of applications and industries. iSagacity CEO, Peter Millett, reports that the partnership with NASA has allowed the company to secure early stage development funding to develop and test its product. \n  Product Outcome\n  iSagacity has developed a new product, Process Data Miner, that uses IMS for a powerful new way of detecting trends in data that are early warning signs of process or equipment problems. Process Data Miner automatically scans data in real time and organizes it into a knowledge base consisting of “data signatures” or patterns that characterize operating behavior of the system. Process Data Miner automatically learns the patterns in data and organizes them for easy knowledge discovery. \n  iSagacity is pleased to count the NASA-developed software amongst its core technologies, and the IMS-based products will provide an elegant solution to the important problem of early warning and diagnostics for both industrial and commercial applications.

From the Roman god of war to Orson Welles’ infamous Halloween broadcast, our nearest planetary neighbor has been viewed with curiosity, suspicion, and awe. Pictures of Mars from 1965 to the present reveal familiar landscapes while also challenging our perceptions and revising our understanding of the processes at work in planets. Frequent discoveries have forced significant revisions to previous theories. \n  Although Mars shares many familiar features with Earth, such as mountains, plains, valleys, and polar ice, the conditions on Mars can vary wildly from those with which we are familiar. The apparently cold, rocky, and dusty wasteland seen through the eyes of spacecraft and Martian probes hints at a dynamic past of volcanic activity, cataclysmic meteors, and raging waters. New discoveries continue to revise our view of our next-door neighbor, and further exploration is now paving the way for a human sortie to the fourth stone from the Sun.\n  NASA’s Mars Exploration Program, a long-term effort of robotic exploration, utilizes wide-angle stereo cameras mounted on NASA’s twin robot geologists, the Mars Exploration Rovers (MERs), launched in 2003. The rovers, named “Spirit” and “Opportunity,” celebrated 4 Earth years of exploration on January 3, 2008, and have sent back a wealth of information on the terrain and composition of the Martian surface. Their marathon performance has far outlasted the intended 90 days of operation, and the two intrepid explorers promise more images and data.\n  Partnership\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      The vehicle-mounted calibrated camera array is used to collect highly accurate and detailed data at the street level.\n    \n  \n  earthmine inc., a street-level 3-D mapping company founded in 2006 and headquartered in Berkeley, California, licensed 3-D data-generation software and algorithms created by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) for the MERs from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). The agreement with JPL and Caltech includes an exclusive and perpetual license for photogrammetric technology allowing for the creation of very dense and accurate 3-D data from stereo panoramic imagery. \n  earthmine combined the software and algorithms, originally used to create a 3-D representation of the local terrain to allow autonomous routing of the MERs through the Martian environment, with its unique capture hardware and Web delivery technology. This system delivers 3-D data with unprecedented density, accuracy, and speed. earthmine utilizes the software and algorithms as a part of its processing pipeline, which automates the creation of high-quality, seamless panoramic imagery with pixel-for-pixel 3-D depth information from its image collection system.\n  “The JPL technology provides an unsurpassed level of accuracy and density in our 3-D data generation process,” said earthmine co-founders John Ristevski and Anthony Fassero. “The problem of generating very dense and accurate 3-D data from wide-angle images is an extremely difficult one, which engineers and scientists at JPL have been working on solving for over a decade. Licensing this technology from JPL gives earthmine a significant advantage and will enable ongoing improvements in our technology.”\n  Product Outcome\n  earthmine’s core technology, called reality indexing, manages the flow of information from hardware, software, and workflow technologies. From streamlined data collection and data processing to Web-based dissemination, the system integrates the information to deliver accurate street-level geospatial data through a Web-based interface. Complete municipalities are collected through high-quality, 3-D panoramic images—including every road, alley, and freeway—to create a complete, consistent, and publicly accessible geospatial view of cities for official and commercial applications. As the cameras mounted on Spirit and Opportunity are designed to optimally record the Martian landscape, earthmine uses an automated vehicle-based camera array which is vertically oriented and has been optimized for the urban environment. This system captures entire metropolitan areas in a few weeks in 3-D, high-resolution panoramic images. \n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      By visually connecting metadata to physical spaces, earthmine allows virtual inventories of our cities.\n    \n  \n  Within each immersive, high-resolution image, each pixel contains real-world latitude, longitude, and elevation information, and thus everything within an image can be accurately located, measured, or modeled using points, lines, or polygons. This data mine can be accessed through a Web-based interface where they can identify, view, and extract information as desired. The comprehensive field-of-view in the imaging system leaves no detail undocumented, allowing visualization of everything from overhead power lines and multistory buildings, to underlying road and curb features.\n  Current applications for the earthmine technology include a major chip manufacturer, mobile communications, satellite imagery, and asset management. earthmine technology has been incorporated by a 311 project in a major city, a county road project for a major metro area, a travel information company, an online real estate company, and a major architecture firm, among others. earthmine also plans to increase focus on solutions for cities and enterprises with strong geographic information system (GIS) initiatives, the existing large and mature GIS system integrator channel that supports them, and the emerging market for Web-based mapping applications. For example, cities and major metropolitan areas can use earthmine resources in reviewing proposed new buildings, upgrading utilities, revising public transportation systems, and for municipal maintenance tasks. Additionally, due to the lightweight delivery system, earthmine has received interest from organizations in mobile navigation, which plan to employ the images as a tool to aid navigation in a city through mobile telephones or in-car navigation systems. \n  “earthmine just might be the key to making the promise of the GeoWeb a reality,” said Chris Shipley, executive producer of DEMO, an annual conference that serves as the launch vehicle for promising technologies and companies. “With its unique ability to put complex geospatial data in a visual context that anyone can understand, earthmine is enabling a new generation of mapping applications.”\n    \n    \n    \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n      \n\n\n"},{"href":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/ct_10.html","text":"Intelligent Memory Module Overcomes Harsh Environments","image":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/images/ct-21.jpeg","story":"\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n  Computer Technology\n  \n\n\n  Originating Technology/NASA Contribution\n  Solar cells, integrated circuits, and sensors are essential to manned and unmanned space flight and exploration, but such systems are highly susceptible to damage from radiation. Especially problematic, the Van Allen radiation belts encircle Earth in concentric radioactive tori at distances from about 6,300 to 38,000 km, though the inner radiation belt can dip as low as 700 km, posing a severe hazard to craft and humans leaving Earth’s atmosphere. To avoid this radiation, the International Space Station and space shuttles orbit at altitudes between 275 and 460 km, below the belts’ range, and Apollo astronauts skirted the edge of the belts to minimize exposure, passing swiftly through thinner sections of the belts and thereby avoiding significant side effects. This radiation can, however, prove detrimental to improperly protected electronics on satellites that spend the majority of their service life in the harsh environment of the belts. Compact, high-performance electronics that can withstand extreme environmental and radiation stress are thus critical to future space missions.\n  Increasing miniaturization of electronics addresses the need for lighter weight in launch payloads, as launch costs put weight at a premium. Likewise, improved memory technologies have reduced size, cost, mass, power demand, and system complexity, and improved high-bandwidth communication to meet the data volume needs of the next-generation high-resolution sensors. This very miniaturization, however, has exacerbated system susceptibility to radiation, as the charge of ions may meet or exceed that of circuitry, overwhelming the circuit and disrupting operation of a satellite. The Hubble Space Telescope, for example, must turn off its sensors when passing through intense radiation to maintain reliable operation. \n  To address the need for improved data quality, additional capacity for raw and processed data, ever-increasing resolution, and radiation tolerance, NASA spurred the development of the Radiation Tolerant Intelligent Memory Stack (RTIMS). Suitable for both geostationary orbit (GEO) and low-Earth orbit (LEO) missions, RTIMS was developed with technology investments by Langley Research Center, Goddard Space Flight Center, ASRC Aerospace Corporation, Irvine Sensors Corporation, and 3D Plus USA Inc. Advances made by the RTIMS technology include:\n  \n    \n      Significant reductions in the size and mass of memory arrays\n    \n    \n      Simplified interface to a large synchronous dynamic random access memory (SDRAM) array with built-in logic for timing read, write, and refresh cycles\n    \n    \n      Novel self-scrubbing and single event functional interrupt (SEFI) detection to improve radiation tolerance\n    \n    \n      Radiation shielding and mitigation structure at the component level instead of system level to increase system reliability\n    \n    \n      Added mission flexibility by operating in a triple modular redundancy (TMR) or in error detection and correction (EDAC) architecture, allowing RTIMS to be configured for the harshness of the expected environment\n    \n    \n      In-flight reconfigurability using static random access memory (SRAM)-based field programmable gate array (FPGA) technology allows RTIMS to overcome both hardware and software errors that may be detected after launch, and adapt to changing mission conditions\n    \n  \n  Partnership\n  3D Plus USA Inc., of McKinney, Texas, licensed RTIMS from Langley for systems and methods to detect a failure event in FPGAs. One of the contributors to RTIMS—incorporating its circuit stacking technology—3D Plus has designed and manufactured many modules (memory-based, CPU, converters) for space applications, and has had its assembly process certified by NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA). 3D Plus is a leading company in 3-D electronics packaging in Europe and is recognized as a high-performance innovator in the design and manufacturing of miniaturized 3-D modules for active, passive, opto-electronics, and micro electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) and micro opto-electro-mechanical systems (MOEMS) components. \n  In partnership with Langley, 3D Plus developed the first high-density and fast access time memory module tolerant of space radiation effects. The project sought to develop and demonstrate an in-flight reconfigurable radiation tolerant stacked memory array based on state-of-the-art chip stacking, radiation shielding, and radiation mitigation technologies. The module can be directly connected to a processor or equivalent and operate like a radiation tolerant static random-access memory (SRAM) with a maximum capacity of 3Gb. \n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      An artist’s concept portraying NASA’s Mars Science Laboratory, a mobile robot for investigating Mars’ past or present ability to sustain microbial life. This picture is what the advanced rover, scheduled for launch in 2009, would look like in Martian terrain from a side aft angle. The mast, rising to about 2.1 meters (6.9 feet) above ground level, supports two remote-sensing instruments: the Mast Camera for stereo color viewing of surrounding terrain and material collected by the arm, and the ChemCam for analyzing the types of atoms in material that laser pulses have vaporized from rocks or soil targets up to about 9 meters (30 feet) away. The ChemCam incorporates the 3D Plus RTIMS.\n    \n  \n  The first prototype intelligent and reconfigurable radiation tolerant memory modules were manufactured and tested by 3D Plus in April 2005. To manage total ionizing dose (TID) and single event effects (SEE) on electronics, specific hardware and patented software protections were developed. The resulting unit significantly reduces board design time as it requires no single event upset (SEU) management and no TID management. The result is a complete computing module—computing cores can be compiled into the onboard FPGA that can then support a distributed, reconfigurable computing architecture. This module decreases design complexity for space-based electronics requiring memory with its simple interface and internal radiation tolerance management (shielding, EDAC, overcurrent protections, and patented software protections). \n  Product Outcome\n  3D Plus introduced the commercial Intelligent Memory Module (IMM), intended for space applications such as commercial or scientific geostationary missions and deep space scientific exploration, and high-reliability computing in other radiation-intensive environments. Nuclear facilities, for instance, utilize automated or remote-controlled nuclear waste handlers that have significant computing and data collection tasks. Nuclear-powered craft, such as aircraft carriers, submarines, and proposed future spacecraft, would also be natural applications for this technology.\n  By using SRAM-based FPGAs, the IMM takes advantage of the inherent ability to change function and substantial data processing performance. The IMM provides a 3Gb memory capacity, including a TMR memory controller for multiple error correction. This controller has been applied to the XQ2V1000 SRAM-based FPGA from the Xilinx Virtex-II family. The modular architecture, SRAM-based FPGA re-programmability, and the large amount of SDRAM allow the implementation of custom applications, such as image data processing, high-speed network switching/monitoring, and other embedded applications. \n  3D Plus is collaborating with several partners on additional developments, including two applications that will see RTIMS return to space. EADS Astrium, Europe’s leading satellite system specialist, is designing RTIMS into a satellite and evaluating it for other applications. Of particular interest, CNES (the French space agency) incorporated RTIMS into the ChemCam instrument for NASA’s Mars Science Laboratory Rover mission, to be launched in 2009 and expected to reach Mars in 2010.\n  Virtex® is a registered trademark of Xilinx Inc.\n    \n    \n    \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n      \n\n\n"},{"href":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/ct_11.html","text":"Integrated Circuit Chip Improves Network Efficiency ","image":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/images/ct-22.jpeg","story":"\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n  Computer Technology\n  \n\n\n  Originating Technology/NASA Contribution\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Goddard’s SpaceWire offers the flexibility to meet a wide range of applications; it offers variable link rates, lower packet overhead, and provides the ability to multiplex discrete signals onto the same cable.\n    \n  \n  Prior to 1999 and the development of SpaceWire, a standard for high-speed links for computer networks managed by the European Space Agency (ESA), there was no high-speed communications protocol for flight electronics. Onboard computers, processing units, and other electronics had to be designed for individual projects and then redesigned for subsequent projects, which increased development periods, costs, and risks. After adopting the SpaceWire protocol in 2000, NASA implemented the standard on the Swift mission, a gamma ray burst-alert telescope launched in November 2004. Scientists and developers on the James Webb Space Telescope further developed the network version of SpaceWire.\n  In essence, SpaceWire enables more science missions at a lower cost, because it provides a standard interface between flight electronics components; new systems need not be custom built to accommodate individual missions, so electronics can be reused. New protocols are helping to standardize higher layers of computer communication.\n  Goddard Space Flight Center improved on the ESA-developed SpaceWire by enabling standard protocols, which included defining quality of service and supporting plug-and-play capabilities. Goddard upgraded SpaceWire to make the routers more efficient and reliable, with features including redundant cables, simultaneous discrete broadcast pulses, prevention of network blockage, and improved verification. Redundant cables simplify management because the user does not need to worry about which connection is available, and simultaneous broadcast signals allow multiple users to broadcast low-latency side-band signal pulses across the network using the same resources for data communication. Additional features have been added to the SpaceWire switch to prevent network blockage so that more robust networks can be designed. Goddard’s verification environment for the link-and-switch implementation continuously randomizes and tests different parts, constantly anticipating situations, which helps improve communications reliability. It has been tested in many different implementations for compatibility.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      After adopting SpaceWire in 2000, NASA scientists and developers improved the network version of SpaceWire for the James Webb Space Telescope (shown here as a scale model).\n    \n  \n  According to Goddard’s Glenn Rakow, SpaceWire development lead, Goddard’s SpaceWire implementation offers many advantages over other protocols. “It’s very basic and simple, which translates to reliable implementations and flexibility for system engineers to meet a wide range of applications,” said Rakow. Unlike Ethernet networks with pre-set link rates (10MHz, 100MHz, and 1GHz), SpaceWire helps save power and improve speed by offering variable link rates with a simple clock-recovery scheme. In addition, it provides lower packet overhead and a smaller implementation, and it provides the ability to multiplex traditional discrete signals onto the same cable. \n  Partnership\n  Headquartered in Rockville, Maryland, BAE Systems Inc. is a global company engaged in advanced electronics for aerospace systems. In order to bridge existing space electronics and Goddard’s new SpaceWire design, the Agency formed a technology transfer partnership with the defense company in 2002 for the first-generation SpaceWire-based application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chip. Goddard integrated the first-generation SpaceWire ASIC on the geostationary operational environmental satellites R Series spacecraft, Advanced Baseline Imager, and NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter single-board computer. \n  Goddard and BAE Systems collaborated again in 2006, when BAE Systems integrated the SpaceWire design into a new ASIC for the radiation-hardened RAD750 single board. BAE Systems sought consultation from Goddard innovators to build a new ASIC incorporating the new SpaceWire implementation.\n  Goddard researchers and the Innovative Partnerships Program (IPP) team helped BAE Systems develop a benefits statement, statement of work, and a schedule for a Space Act Agreement. Because of its partnership, Goddard helped BAE Systems meet the tight ASIC design schedule. Rakow and the team at Goddard also provided technical support to BAE. According to Rakow, the collaboration between BAE Systems and Goddard is working well: “Industry has expertise that NASA doesn’t have and vice versa, and that exchange will benefit the SpaceWire standard.” \n  Product Outcome\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Goddard and BAE Systems collaborated on a SpaceWire-based application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chip.\n    \n  \n  The new BAE Systems ASICs are comprised entirely of reusable core elements, many of which are already flight-proven; they also incorporate a four-port SpaceWire router with two local ports, dual PCI bus interfaces, a microcontroller, 32KB of internal memory, and a memory controller for additional external memory use. The ASIC decreases the part count, overall communication system complexity, ongoing costs, and power requirements for the system’s board while improving speed and reliability. \n  The SpaceWire-based ASIC appeals to commercial, military, and government aerospace customers because of its easy integration into onboard systems. Other industry SpaceWire implementations require multiple support chips rather than the single ASIC approach. Various aspects of SpaceWire illustrate its adaptability: Systems administrators can configure the ASIC according to the number of serial and local ports, while incorporating features from different systems. The ASIC is also available as a standalone chip for users to incorporate in their designs.\n  Goddard and BAE Systems continue to pursue ways to capitalize on their combined strengths. In 2008, new plans are underway to expand the current four-port SpaceWire ASIC to an eight-port implementation with an eye toward 2010 to rollout this design.\n    \n    \n    \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n      \n\n\n\n"},{"href":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/ip.html","text":" Industrial Productivity","image":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/images/Spinoff_-Nav.gif","story":"\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  NASA technologies aid industry.

Developed by the Energy and Chassis Division of the Detroit-based Delphi Corporation (a spinoff company formed by General Motors in 1999), DRW can reduce the cycle time and fabrication cost for a variety of structures using hollow members. Applications include automotive, aerospace, structural, and fluid handling applications. \n  As the name implies, DRW applies the heat and force of resistance welding, with tooling designed to create the necessary deformation. The process bonds metals atomically and creates solid-state joints through the heating and deformation of the mating surfaces, and as such, requires no additional filler materials. Metal tubes are joined to solid metal forms, sheet metal, and other tubes, creating nearly instantaneous, full-strength, leak-tight welds that can be used to build lean structural assemblies. The leak-tight joints are capable of holding fluids or gasses under pressure and heat, and can have strength exceeding that of the parent metals. DRW promises increases in performance and design flexibility while helping to cut cost, investment, and weight. \n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Deformation resistance welding uses include exhaust systems, tubular space frames, fluid-based mechanical systems, and load-bearing structural applications.\n    \n  \n  In early studies, DRW demonstrated improved quality over conventional welding methods and novel joining capabilities. These studies caught NASA’s eye, and the Space Agency funded further development. \n  Partnership\n  NASA’s Glenn Research Center, Delphi, and the Michigan Research Institute (MRI) entered into a research project to study the use of DRW in the construction and repair of stationary structures with multiple geometries and dissimilar materials, such as those NASA might use on the Moon or Mars. Delphi worked with the MRI (a not-for-profit organization created to speed the development of emerging technologies) to obtain an initial $2.17 million in the form of two grants, which were used to help develop new weld joint design configurations, perfect existing welding techniques, and equip a laboratory with technicians to test DRW. NASA analyzed the test results to understand how DRW could be used to weld different types of metal on Earth and in space, with an eye toward eventually using DRW to weld structures on the Moon and Mars.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Deformation resistance welding’s potential applications are numerous, though SpaceForm Inc. has targeted the automotive and non-automotive industries as ideal launch points for this state-of-the-art new technology.\n    \n  \n  Initial testing proved promising, and in 2005, Delphi created SpaceForm Inc., also of Detroit, to commercialize the DRW technology. NASA, encouraged by the testing, provided additional funding for a joint research partnership between Delphi, SpaceForm, and the Edison Welding Institute (EWI). Based in Columbus, Ohio, EWI is North America’s leading engineering and technology organization dedicated to welding and materials joining. EWI’s staff provides materials joining assistance, contract research, consulting services, and training to over 3,300 member company locations, representing world-class leaders in the aerospace, automotive, defense, energy, government, heavy manufacturing, medical, and electronics industries. \n  The EWI collaboration continued development of the DRW process and explored applications in ferrous and non-ferrous metals, dissimilar material joints, lean tubular structures, and concepts for future manufacturing cells. With EWI and NASA support, SpaceForm was able to advance DRW development toward production capabilities and narrow manufacturing parameters, making it a reliable, proven process. For these accomplishments, SpaceForm was awarded the Michigan Technology Leaders’ “Corporate Partnership Award” for 2006.\n  “We’re very pleased to have NASA’s continued support,” said Tim Forbes, director of commercialization and licensing at Delphi Technologies Inc., a subsidiary of Delphi Corporation. “The funded development projects with NASA have allowed us to gain a better understanding of the DRW joining process relative to a variety of materials, multiple joint configurations, joints with dissimilar materials, and the associated tooling and fixturing requirements. This work is supporting NASA objectives and is helping Delphi develop DRW for additional markets and customers.”\n  Product Outcome\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Deformation resistance welding drastically reduces welding, manufacturing, and maintenance costs.\n    \n  \n  Current welding technologies are burdened by significant business and engineering challenges, including high costs of equipment and labor, heat-affected zones, limited automation, and inconsistent quality. DRW addresses each of those issues, while drastically reducing welding, manufacturing, and maintenance costs.\n  Manufacturers can expect lowered materials and capital costs and a significant reduction in welding cycle time. Additional advantages include localized heat application, and solid-state weld flexibility. The process can join dissimilar materials and shapes, is geometry-independent, and still automation friendly. Further, DRW is compliant (code case 2463) with the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and recognized for tube-to-tubesheet and heat exchanger manufacturing. \n  In addition to boasting a handful of manufacturing advantages, end-users will appreciate that the process eliminates weld leakage, that the weld is stronger than the parent metal, and that the method extends a product’s service life. The process also eliminates tube thinning and porosity. \n  “The list of potential applications quickly grew from an initial chassis/suspension application,” said Jayson D. Pankin, Delphi’s new venture creation specialist and co-founder of SpaceForm Inc. “Other potential automotive applications, which could benefit from tube construction, like roof frames, cross-car beams, exhaust systems, and chassis module assemblies were immediate opportunities. The technology also has potential applications in medical devices, bridges, water heaters, plumbing, and more. Virtually anything that could benefit from tube welding.”\n  DRW can reduce cycle time and cost in manufacturing an array of tubular structures. The technology can provide enhanced design flexibility in transportation and stationary applications, including motorcycles, recreational vehicles, bicycles, and wheelchairs, all while cutting cost investment in time and material.\n    \n    \n    \n          \n            \n            \n            \n            \n          \n      \n\n"},{"href":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/ip_2.html","text":"Sensors Increase Productivity in Harsh Environments ","image":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/images/ip-4.gif","story":"\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n  Industrial Productivity\n  \n\n\n  Originating Technology/NASA Contribution\n  A  team of scientists at Glenn Research Center, operating under the Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate’s Aviation Safety and Fundamental Aeronautics programs, developed a series of technologies for testing aircraft engine combustion chambers. The team, led by electronics engineer Dr. Robert Okojie, designed a packaging technique and chip fabrication methods for creating silicon carbide (SiC) pressure sensors to improve jet engine testing. According to Okojie, the team was “working to develop pressure sensors that would be used to more accurately measure pressure inside jet engine combustion chambers where the temperature is very high.” Okojie’s team also understood that “due to their temperature limitations, conventional pressure sensors are usually kept further away from the sensed environment. As a result, measurement accuracy is generally compromised. In addition, vital dynamic information could be lost due to frequency attenuation. This new technology is meant to be inserted in close proximity with the sensed environment, thus eliminating these disadvantages.”\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Glenn Research Center licensed three patents, covering high-temperature, harsh-environment, silicon carbide pressure sensors, to Endevco Corporation.\n    \n  \n  SiC-based pressure sensors fabricated using these NASA technologies can operate for over 130 hours at 600 °C. These durable chips are applicable in engine ground testing and short-duration flight test instrumentation. Kathy Needham, director of the Technology Transfer and Partnership Office at Glenn, explains, “We have been spearheading the use of silicon carbide in sensors for some time now—the material withstands high temperatures and allows measurements to be taken closer to the source. As an added advantage, the new sensors are less complex than current, similar sensors, reducing the likelihood of performance failure, allowing them to be manufactured relatively inexpensively, and reducing system maintenance needs.”\n  These factors also lend the technology to other uses, including commercial jet testing, deep well-drilling applications where pressure and temperature increase with drilling depth, and in automobile combustion chambers. As Okojie explains, “I see this technology being inserted in commercial jet engines and in deep wells while prospecting for oil. In commercial engine use, more accurate measurement of pressure would lead to improved engine safety by monitoring precursors of thermo-acoustic instability that leads to flame-out, efficient combustion of fuel and reduction of unwanted emission of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides. In deep well drilling, it would allow for longer term insertion into the wells, thereby significantly saving the cost of equipment maintenance and down time.”\n  Partnership\n  To explore and develop these commercial uses, California’s San Juan Capistrano-based Endevco Corporation, a division of the Meggitt PLC group, licensed three patents covering the high-temperature, harsh-environment silicon carbide pressure sensors from Glenn. Collaboration between the two dates back to 2000, when, during combustion tests, Glenn used an Endevco silicon-based accelerometer as a benchmark device to validate its SiC accelerometer. The test results showed that the NASA device operated as well as the Endevco model, but the NASA-developed device had the added advantage of operating at much higher temperatures. This led to discussions between Endevco and Glenn about licensing opportunities to acquire Glenn’s SiC pressure and accelerometer sensor fabrication and packaging technologies. \n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Dr. Robert Okojie, a researcher in the Sensors and Electronics Branch at Glenn, is a testament to the quality of a research environment that nurtures talent and ability at Glenn Research Center.\n    \n  \n  Endevco met with the Glenn researchers on numerous occasions during the following years. After witnessing the advantages of the NASA technology first-hand, the company licensed the three NASA patents for commercial development with the caveat that Okojie would continue to work on the project and help the company overcome any outstanding technical issues. Okojie agrees with the importance of this arrangement. “The transfer of this technology to the commercial sector,” he says, “would extend the utilization of the products beyond the government (NASA, DOE, and DoD) to civil aviation, with derivative applications particularly in the efficient management of fuel combustion and the reduction of unwanted combustion byproducts.”\n  Building on years of already successful collaboration, the partnership now steers these novel technologies toward their envisioned commercial applications. “Endevco is the ideal partner to bring this NASA technology to market, since the company already has a proven track record in the field and is now willing to commit to making this new technology accessible to industry,” Needham elaborates. “The company,” she continues, “is planning a new product line, enabling this high-performance NASA technology to achieve widespread use.”\n  Product Outcome\n  Founded in 1947, Endevco supports its customers with a global network of manufacturing and research facilities, sales offices, and field engineers, providing trusted solutions for the world’s most challenging measurement applications. In its more than 60 years of operation, Endevco has become a world leader in sensing solutions for demanding vibration, shock, and pressure applications. It was the company NASA trusted when it needed a benchmark device for its testing, and\t\t\t\t  when the company saw that NASA had developed technologies that could improve the sensing field, it acted on the opportunity to license the cutting-edge know-how.

Twice as long and three times as heavy as the Mars Exploration Rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) will collect Martian soil and rock samples and analyze them for organic compounds and environmental conditions that could have supported microbial life. \n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      The Mars Science Laboratory rover is larger and can travel farther than Spirit and Opportunity, NASA’s two Mars Exploration Rovers that began exploring the Red Planet in early 2004.\n    \n  \n  MSL will be the first planetary mission to use precision landing techniques, steering itself toward the Martian surface similar to the way the space shuttle controls its entry through the Earth’s upper atmosphere. In this way, the spacecraft will fly to a desired location above the surface of Mars before deploying its parachute for the final landing. As currently envisioned, in the final minutes before touchdown, the spacecraft will activate its parachute and retrorockets before lowering the rover package to the surface on a tether (similar to the way a sky crane helicopter moves a large object). This landing method will enable the rover to land in an area 20 to 40 kilometers (12 to 24 miles) long, about the size of a small crater or wide canyon and three to five times smaller than previous landing zones on Mars. NASA plans to select a landing site on the basis of highly detailed images sent to Earth by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, in addition to data from earlier missions.\n  Like the twin rovers now on the surface of Mars, the MSL will have six wheels, and cameras mounted on a mast. Unlike the twin rovers, it will carry a laser for vaporizing a thin layer from the surface of a rock to analyze the elemental composition of the underlying materials, and will be able to collect rock and soil samples and distribute them to onboard test chambers for chemical analysis. Its design includes a suite of scientific instruments for identifying organic compounds such as proteins, amino acids, and other acids and bases that attach themselves to carbon backbones and are essential to life as we know it. MSL will also identify features such as atmospheric gasses that may be associated with biological activity.\n  Using these tools, the MSL will examine Martian rocks and soils in greater detail than ever before to determine the geologic processes that formed them; study the Martian atmosphere; and determine the distribution and circulation of water and carbon dioxide, whether frozen, liquid, or gaseous. \n  The rover will carry a radioisotope power system that generates electricity from the heat of plutonium’s radioactive decay. This power source gives the mission an operating lifespan on Mars’ surface of a full Martian year (687 Earth days) or more while also providing significantly greater mobility and operational flexibility, enhanced science payload capability, and exploration of a much larger range of latitudes and altitudes than was possible on previous missions to Mars.\n  Partnership\n  inXitu Inc., of Mountain View, California, a leader in portable X-ray diffraction/X-ray fluorescence (XRD/XRF) instrumentation, entered into a Phase II Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contract with Ames Research Center. The company specializes in developing technologies for the next generation of scientific instruments for materials analysis. It rapidly evolved throughout the SBIR Phase II research, starting as a sole proprietorship and growing to a 10-employee corporation. Critical findings from the research were applied to the CheMin instrument (an instrument with chemical and mineral identification capabilities included in the analytical laboratory of MSL), enabling robust operation of its sample handling system.\n  During this SBIR Phase II research, inXitu designed and built an automated sample handling system for planetary XRD instruments that enables quality analysis of coarse-grained materials (XRD analyzes the crystalline arrangements of atoms or molecules in solids). The sample handling method developed by inXitu allows direct analysis of materials obtained from drills or rock crushers, eliminating the need for the extensive sample preparation typically required for XRD analysis. Sample loading and removal have been automated without complex mechanisms and with a minimum of moving parts.\n  inXitu’s sample handling system could find a wide range of applications in research and industrial laboratories as a means to load powdered samples for analysis or process control. Potential industries include chemical, cement, inks, pharmaceutical, ceramics, and forensics. Additional applications include characterizing materials that cannot be ground to a fine size, such as explosives and research pharmaceuticals.\n  Product Outcome\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      inXitu’s portable rock and mineral analysis device was tested at the Mars Analog site in Spitsbergen, Norway.\n    \n  \n  inXitu’s Terra product is the first truly portable XRD/XRF system designed specifically for rock and mineral analysis. XRD is the most definitive technique to accurately determine the mineralogical composition of rocks and soils. Phase identification is obtained by comparing the diffraction signature of a sample with a database of XRD mineral patterns. The addition of XRF informs on the nature of the chemical elements in the sample which allows easy screening during the phase identification process and can alleviate rare uncertainties.\n  Terra is the result of over a decade of research and development for space exploration instrumentation. Using a low-power X-ray source and energy dispersive 2-D charge coupled device (CCD) detector, XRD and XRF data are obtained with no moving parts, providing an unparalleled robustness. The system provides fast identification capabilities thanks to its optimized geometry and high-sensitivity detector. With the company’s patented sample handling system, only minimal sample preparation is required. Single minerals or simple mixtures can be identified after just a few minutes of integration.\n  Terra is built in a rugged, compact case for easy transport and operates autonomously via an embedded computer. In addition to a basic user interface on the instrument panel, a graphic user interface is available through a Wi-Fi link from any laptop or hand-held computer to control the instrument, preview live data, explore archive files, and download data. \n  Terra was first designed as a field geology/mineralogy instrument, but it can find a range of other applications where portability and fast analysis using XRD are required (mining, forensics, homeland security, etc.). Several Terra instruments are currently being used by NASA geologists to practice for the operational phase of the Mars Science Laboratory rover XRD instrument.\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n      \n\n\n"},{"href":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/ip_4.html","text":"NASA Design Strengthens Welds ","image":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/images/ip-8.jpeg","story":"\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n  Industrial Productivity\n      \n    Originating Technology/NASA Contribution\n  \n  \n  The Welding Institute (TWI), a nonprofit professional organization based out of the United Kingdom and devoted to the industry of joining materials, engineering, and allied technologies, developed a novel form of welding in the 1990s. Friction stir welding (FSW), the name under which it was patented, has been widely recognized as providing greatly improved weld properties over conventional fusion welds, and has been applied to manufacturing industries, including aircraft, marine, shipbuilding, including building decks for car ferries, trucking, railroading, large tank structure assembly, fuel tanks, radioactive waste container manufacturing, automotive hybrid aluminum, and the aerospace industry, where it is used to weld the aluminum external tank of the space shuttle. \n  FSW is a solid-state joining process—a combination of extruding and forging—ideal for use when the original metal characteristics must remain as unchanged as possible. During the FSW process, the pin of a cylindrical shouldered tool is slowly plunged into the joint between the two materials to be welded. The pin is then rotated at high speed, creating friction between the wear-resistant welding tool and the work piece. The resulting friction creates a plasticized shaft of material around the pin. As the pin moves forward in the joint, it “stirs,” or crushes, the plasticized material, creating a forged bond, or weld.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n          \n        \n    \n      Since its invention, friction stir welding has received worldwide attention, and today, many companies around the world are using the technology in production, particularly for joining aluminum alloys.\n        \n  \n  Although the FSW process is more reliable and maintains higher material properties than conventional welding methods, two major drawbacks with the initial design impacted the efficacy of the process: the requirement for different-length pin tools when welding materials of varying thickness, and the reliance on a pin tool that left an exit, or “keyhole,” at the end of the weld. The latter was a reliability concern, particularly when welding cylindrical items such as drums, pipes, and storage tanks, where the keyhole left by the retracted pin created a weakness in the weld and required an additional step to fill.\n  While exploring methods to improve the use of FSW in manufacturing, engineers at Marshall Space Flight Center (a licensee of TWI’s technology) created new pin tool technologies, including an automatic retractable pin tool, to address the method’s shortcomings. The tool uses a computer-controlled motor to automatically retract the pin into the shoulder of the tool at the end of the weld, preventing keyholes. The new technology addressed the limitations, and Marshall’s innovative retractable pin tool has since contributed to customized FSW that has been proven to provide routinely reliable welds.\n  Partnership\n  The NASA engineers patented their developments and sought commercial licensees for their new innovations. MTS Systems Corporation, of Eden Prairie, Minnesota, discovered the NASA-developed technology and then signed a co-exclusive license agreement to commercialize Marshall’s auto-adjustable pin tool for a FSW patent in 2001. MTS is actively developing the FSW process, as well as new technologies to improve existing applications and to develop new ones. In addition, MTS has introduced the NASA technology to a wide variety of clients, in a wider variety of industries. \n  Product Outcome \n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \n    \n      The friction stir welding process is currently being used by several automotive companies and suppliers, including the manufacturing of wheel rims.\n        \n  \n  MTS worked with the NASA technology and developed a flexible system that enables advanced FSW applications for high-strength structural alloys. The product also offers the added bonuses of being cost-competitive, efficient, and, most importantly, versatile. Customers include automotive, aerospace, and other industries. \n  The FSW system available from MTS offers users many advantages over conventional welding, including the ability to work with diverse materials; a wide range of alloys, including previously unweldable aluminums and high-temperature materials, while minimizing material distortion. This flexibility makes it adaptable to virtually any application. \n  The MTS system provides durable joints, with two to three times the fatigue resistance of traditional joining technologies like fusion welding or riveting, and has no keyholes. Since the pin is retracted automatically at the end of the welding process, and the hole is sealed, the technique produces consistent bonds.\n  MTS has supplied a FSW production system to an aluminum rim manufacturer in Norway. The Volvo XC 90 SUV rim will be manufactured using a cast aluminum face with a spun formed aluminum sheet (hybrid rim). The two pieces are friction stir welded by internal and external weld joints. Jim Freeman, MTS welding engineer, commented that “the customer was using an addition procedure to eliminate the keyhole; by introducing the retractable pin tool technology the cycle time was reduced by 70 percent.” \n  FSW also lends itself to versatile welds, operating in all positions and able to create both straight welds and those requiring complex shapes. It even works with tapered-thickness weld joints, where the pin is able to maintain full penetration. \n  This technique, which does not require any consumables, is also advantageous, in that it does not create any environmental detriment, such as sparking, noise, or fumes. In addition, MTS’s FSW process is also safer than conventional welding, since it does not create hazards such as toxic welding fumes, radiation, high voltage, liquid metal spatter, or arcing. \n  MTS is currently engaged in several research projects to expand the usefulness of FSW. While the company does not normally engage in research initiatives, these specific projects will assist customers in developing uses for the FSW technique. \n  First, MTS and an aircraft manufacturing customer developed a pin control mode utilizing the retractable pin tool. Using a surface sensor, the pin is located relative to the part surface using pin position control, while the shoulder is in force control. This control mode allowed the customer to weld a 0.012-inch-thick butt joint using the retractable pin tool. \n  The company also participated in a dual-use science and technology agreement with the U.S. Navy’s Office of Naval Research to develop commercial and military applications for joining high-strength structural alloys. Program participants in addition to MTS include the University of South Carolina, General Dynamics Corporation’s Bath Iron Works and Electric Boat, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and the Naval Surface Warfare Center–Carderock Division. \n  In another research initiative to advance the uses of FSW in industrial applications, MTS, along with several other recognized industrial leaders (e.g., NASA, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Spirit Aerosystems, General Motors) is a cooperative partner at the Center for Friction Stir Processing (CFSP). This is a multi-institutional National Science Foundation Industry/University Cooperative Research Center founded in August 2004. Methods like the retractable pin tool are a critical part of the CFSP technology development roadmap.\n  Having licensed the NASA technology and undertaken several initiatives to improve the commercial FSW technique, MTS is now in a unique position to contribute back to the Space Program, as its product has been selected by Marshall for use in welding upper-stage cryogenic hardware for the Constellation Program’s Ares rockets.\n    \n    \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n  \n"},{"href":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/ip_5.html","text":"Polyimide Boosts High-Temperature Performance ","image":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/images/R-D_thumb_opt.jpeg","story":"\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n    \n    Industrial Productivity\n  \n\n\n  Originating Technology/NASA Contribution\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Polyimide composites are introduced to the harsh environmental loads familiar to space launch propulsion systems in the combustion chamber of a rocket-based combined-cycle demonstrator.\n    \n  \n  Polyimides are a class of polymers notable for chemical, wear, radiation, and temperature resistance, characteristics that have led to applications as diverse as aerospace engine housings and electronics packaging. Other applications include electronics, ranging from insulation for flexible cables to use as a high-temperature adhesive in the semiconductor industry. High-temperature polyimide carbon fiber composites are also used in non-loading structural components in aircrafts, weapon systems, and space vehicles. The appeal of polyimides is attributable to their unique combination of high-thermal stability, good chemical and solvent resistance, as well as excellent retention of mechanical properties at high temperature. \n  The polymerization of monomeric reactants (PMR) addition polyimide technology was developed in the mid-1970s at NASA’s Lewis Research Center (renamed Glenn Research Center in 1999). This technology used an alcohol solution of polyimide monomers to make “prepreg,” graphite or glass fiber bundles impregnated with polyimide resins, which could be thermally cured into composites with low voids, eliminating the difficulty of removing high-boiling solvents often used for condensation (step-polymerization) polyimides.\n  The initial PMR resin, known as PMR-15, is still commercially available and is used worldwide by the aerospace industry as the state-of-the-art resin for high-temperature polyimide composite applications; including engine bypass ducts, nozzle flaps, bushings, and bearings. PMR-15 can also be formualted into adhesives and coatings, and offers easy composite processing, excellent mechanical property retention for long-term use at temperatures up to 288 °C (550 °F), and is relatively inexpensive. As such, PMR-15 is widely regarded as a leading high-temperature polymer matrix composite for aircraft engine components. \n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      The DMBZ-15 resin can be made into lightweight bushings and polyimide/carbon fiber composite components for high-temperature applications.\n    \n  \n  However, PMR-15 is made from methylene dianiline (MDA), a known carcinogen and a liver toxin, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) imposes strict regulations on the handling of MDA during the fabrication of PMR-15 composites. Recent concerns about the safety of workers involved in the manufacture and repair of PMR-15 components have led to the implementation of costly protective measures to limit worker exposure and ensure workplace safety.\n  Glenn researchers have continued to work on improving the properties and applicability of polyimides, with the ultimate goal of offering the aerospace, chemical, and automotive industries a lower toxicity alternative to PMR-15 that maintains similar processability, stability, and mechanical properties. The new polyimide developed by Dr. Kathy Chuang and Raymond Vannucci under NASA’s Advanced Subsonic Technology (AST) program, named DMBZ-15, replaces MDA with a noncoplanar diamine, 2,2´-dimethylbenzidine (DMBZ). \n  The DMBZ-15 composition has a glass transition temperature of 414 °C (777 °F). This constitutes an increase in use temperature of 55 °C (100 °F) over the state-of-the-art PMR-15 composites and enables the development of fiber-reinforced polymer matrix composites with use temperatures as high as 343 °C (650 °F). DMBZ-15 graphite fiber reinforced composites exhibit an operational temperature range up to 335 °C (635 °F) and good thermo-oxidative stability in aircraft engine or missile environments.\n  Partnership\n  In 2002, Maverick Corporation, of Blue Ash, Ohio, licensed the DMBZ-15 technology.\n  In 2003, Chuang and Vannucci along with Maverick’s Dr. Robert Gray and Eric Collins received R&D Magazine’s 2003 “R&D 100” award recognizing DMBZ-15 among the best 100 new inventions of the year. \n    In 2004, the DMBZ-15 technology received a NASA Space Act Award.\n  Product Outcome\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      The “R&D 100” award-winning DMBZ-15 high-temperature polyimide.\n    \n  \n  DMBZ-15 bushings exhibit better wear resistance than state-of-the-art PMR-15. This ultrahigh-temperature material has a wide range of potential applications from aerospace (e.g., aircraft engine and airframe components, space transportation airframe and propulsion systems, and missiles) to bushings and bearings for non-aerospace applications (e.g., oil drilling, rolling mill). DMBZ-15 lightweight composites provide substantial weight savings and reduced machining costs compared to the same component made with more traditional metallic materials. Using solvent-assisted resin transfer molding, complex parts such as engine center vent tubes can be produced with braided reinforcement.\n  The DMBZ-15 polyimide has proven useful as a resin matrix with glass, quartz, and carbon fibers for lightweight, high-temperature composite applications similar to PMR-15 in aircraft engine components. Due to its higher temperature capability, it is especially suitable for use in missile applications, including fins, radon, and body components. Of particular interest to NASA, DMBZ-15 is well-suited to use as face sheets with honeycombs or thermal protection systems for reusable launch vehicles, which encounter elevated temperatures during launch and reentry. Other applications include use with chopped fibers to make bushings and bearings for engine or oil drilling components, and in high-temperature coating and ink applications. The light weight of DMBZ-15 polyimide composites invites use in secondary, non-load bearing aircraft engine components such as vent tubes, nozzle flaps and bushings, as well as for oil drilling components. Lightweight polymer composites also offer significant weight savings and subsequent improvements in fuel efficiency in aerospace propulsion and automotive applications.\n    \n    \n    \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n    \n\n"},{"href":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/ip_6.html","text":"NASA Innovation Builds Better Nanotubes ","image":"http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/images/ip-14.jpeg","story":"\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n  Industrial Productivity\n  \n\n\n  Originating Technology/NASA Contribution\n  One of the basic nanotechnology structures, the carbon nanotube, is a graphite sheet one atomic layer thick that is wrapped on itself to create an extraordinarily thin, strong tube. Although carbon nanotubes were discovered more than 15 years ago, their use has been limited due to the complex, dangerous, and expensive methods for their production. This unwieldy process has made widespread application of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) cost-prohibitive up until now.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Retired Goddard Space Flight Center researcher Jeannette Benavides prepares her award-winning, low-cost process for manufacturing high-purity, single-walled carbon nanotubes. This innovative manufacturing process uses helium arc welding to vaporize a carbon rod (anode), with the nanotubes forming in the soot deposited onto a water-cooled carbon cathode.\n    \n  \n  Goddard Space Flight Center has made a major step forward in limiting these drawbacks. While traditional manufacturing methods use a metal catalyst to form the tubes, NASA researchers pinpointed this step as the cause of many of the drawbacks that were impeding development of SWCNTs. NASA researchers, under the direction of Goddard’s Jeannette Benavides, discovered a simple, safe, and inexpensive method to create SWCNTs without the use of a metal catalyst. Benefits of this process include lowered manufacturing costs, a more robust product, and a simpler, safer process that produces a higher purity nanotube. NASA’s SWCNT manufacturing process eliminates the costs associated with the use of metal catalysts, including the cost of product purification.\n  The removal of the catalyst not only reduces cost, but results in high-quality, very pure SWCNTs. Because NASA’s process does not use a metal catalyst, no metal particles need to be removed from the final product. Eliminating the presence of metallic impurities results in the SWCNTs exhibiting higher degradation temperatures (650 °C rather than 500 °C) and eliminates damage to the SWCNTs by the purification process.\n  In addition to saving costs and creating a purer product, this new method also introduces features that make production simpler and safer. Unlike most current methods—which require expensive equipment (e.g., vacuum chamber), dangerous gasses, and extensive technical knowledge to operate—NASA’s simple SWCNT manufacturing process needs only an arc welder, a helium purge, an ice-water bath, and basic processing experience to begin production. This simple method also offers an increase in quantity. Whereas traditional catalytic arc discharge methods produce an “as prepared” sample with a 30 to 50 percent SWCNT yield, NASA’s method produces SWCNTs at an average yield of 70 percent.\n  Partnership\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Thousands of times smaller than the average human hair, carbon nanotubes are extremely long and thin yet strong, making them a key nanotechnology structure. \n    \n  \n  Nanotailor Inc., a nanomaterials company specializing in SWCNTs, based in Austin, Texas, licensed Goddard’s unique SWCNT fabrication process with plans to make high-quality, low-cost SWCNTs available commercially. \n  “The nanotech industry is growing by more than 40 percent a year, but multi-walled carbon nanotubes have been the primary technology used. Single-walled technology just hasn’t taken off because of the cost,” notes Ramon Perales, president and chief executive officer of Nanotailor. “If we can get the cost down, we can be a step ahead and make higher quality nanotechnology more affordable.” Other companies that have licensed the process include Idaho Space Materials Inc., a start-up in Boise, and American GFM Corporation, in Chesapeake, Virginia.\n  With a license agreement in place, Nanotailor built and tested a prototype based on Goddard’s process. Device integrators and nanotechnology-based device companies are among Nanotailor’s first customers, though the company hopes to cater to a wide variety of industries and research organizations. \n  According to Dr. Reginald Parker, chief technical officer of Nanotailor, “Most industries using multi-walled tubes and technologies that require property improvement without a shift in weight will be able to benefit from this technology. A better product at a lower price will bring higher quality nanotechnology to biomaterials, advanced materials, space exploration, highway and building construction . . . the list seems endless as nanotubes have diverse and excellent properties.”\n  Product Outcome\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Inventor Jeannette Benavides was honored at the Nano 50 Awards ceremony.\n    \n  \n  Nanotailor produces an optimized product based upon intellectual property licensed from NASA.

SWCNTs also can be used to reinforce composites. Applications include dopants to create electrically conductive polymers; and easier monitoring of composites in critical applications (e.g., aircraft).\n    \n    \n      Molecular containment: SWCNTs can be used to contain various elements, such as hydrogen for fuel cells and lithium boron hydrate for radiation shielding.\n    \n  \n  During September 2007, Nanotailor announced that its method for manufacturing high-quality carbon nanotubes was selected as a winner of the third annual Nanotech Briefs Nano 50 Awards.
